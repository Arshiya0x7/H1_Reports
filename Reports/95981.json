  "vulnerability_information": "So i found a http response splitting issue in your website. If we visit the following url:\n\nhttps://www.binary.com/user/validate_link?step=account&verify_token=sometoken\n\nWe will get a response header that says: \n\n    Set-Cookie: verify_token=sometoken; expires=Wed, 28 Oct 2015 23:31:35 GMT; domain=.binary.com; path=/; secure\n\nHowever this value doesnt seem to be urlencoded which gives the attacker the option to create his own response header. For example if you were to visit:\n\nhttps://www.binary.com/user/validate_link?step=account&verify_token=%0aSet-Cookie:%20GerbenJavado=Awesome;%0a\n\nThe following response header will be included in the response: (shameless plug)\n\n    Set-Cookie: GerbenJavado=Awesome;\n\n#Attacker Scenario\nSince this attack doesnt require any user interaction to be exploited, a attacker could do lots of fun stuff using this vulnerability by including a malicious url in a Iframe or even in a IMG tag. \n\n- As the example shows the attacker can set cookies for the user on binary.com\n- The attacker can disable or bypass security headers placed by the server\n\nOne restricition the attacker has is that the request is a redirect. This made it for me impossible to XSS attacks or Cache Poisining. Maybe you guys could look a bit into this further. However i would argue that because of the fact user interaction is not needed and the fact that the attacker can set his own headers (including cookies) the attack is fairly scary.\n\n",
