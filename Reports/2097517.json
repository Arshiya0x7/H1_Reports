  "vulnerability_information": "Summary: Waketime's payment gateway does not encrypt data in transit, which could allow an attacker to intercept and capture card information. This vulnerability could be exploited by a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, in which the attacker would insert themselves between the user and the payment gateway, intercepting the data as it is transmitted.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nVisit the Waketime website.\nProceed to subscribe and enter your credit card information.\nObserve that the data is not encrypted in transit.\nExpected Results: The data should be encrypted in transit, using a secure protocol.\n\nActual Results: The data is not encrypted in transit, and could be intercepted by an attacker.\n\n## Impact\n\nA man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker inserts themselves between two parties, intercepting and modifying the communication between them.",
