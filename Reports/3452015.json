This security researcher went through an then located exactly where the vulnerability was introduced within the [platform-core](https://github.com/enjin/platform-core) repository so that a rapid fix could be introduced. The code identified by @pwnie was confirmed to be correct and the fix addressed the logic in question.\n\nSince authentication isn't strictly necessary for most of the queries, it was possible to perform a large number of different queries without any errors occurring using this bypass. However, for those queries that did perform authentication checks, it would later trigger a server error as the authentication logic later failed when retrieving the user's information.",
