  "vulnerability_information": "Hello, Reddit!\nI hope you are okay in there.\nFirst of all, I want to say one thing, maybe you will not appreciate this report, but at least this report can help users from France to understand the content policy of Reddit, so that if you fix this problem, users from France will understand the policy properly.\n\nWhich content is allowed, and which is not.\n\nEven though I'm not from France, I thought it wouldn't hurt me to report this.\n\nReproduction step:\n• Visit https://www.redditinc.com/fr/policies/moderator-guidelines (In French)\n• Scroll and see \"You are required to comply with our Content Policy\", you can click that\n• You will be redirected to a 404 page\n\n## Impact\n\nMaybe it's not a serious vulnerability, but at least you fixed it.\nUsers who are from France will not know what content rules they can create and what content rules they can't create.\n\nI read that Reddit requires each of its users to comply with their content policies, but if the page for a French user is 404, they won't understand it, and maybe if the user is breaking the law by posting something very fatal, they can evade in court.\n\nFor example saying \"REDDIT doesn't make any content policy rules\".\n\nMaybe it's weird, but at least if you fix this, there won't be any weird problems like that.\n\n\nBest Regards.\nArdyan Vicky Ramadan.",

This could serve as an alibi in court for French Reddit users who commit violations, even though it sounds very peculiar.\n\nThe majority of French people do not use English, approximately 87.2% use French as their language (source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_France).\n\nTherefore, French users are more likely to use the French language on the Reddit application. The broken Content Policy page can hinder French users' understanding of its contents.",
