  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:** \nHey team,\nwhile looking at your Disclosed reports I noticed that on report #2082680 you awarded the user with a Bonus and no bounty at all it was hidden as well because the Activity shows that \"HackerOne rewarded someone with a bounty. \" which also included the **Bonus**, upon checking the #2082680.json  I did not found the \"bonus_amount\" parameter at all or any number representing ████ which was the bonus given to the user thus it was supposed to be a Confidential but it's now exposed to the public.\n\nAs a PoC look at this report showing the Bonus amount in JSON \nA bonus of ███████ was given to the user of this report as well  https://hackerone.com/reports/1952124.json but upon checking the JSON format of this you can clearly see it's mentioned in the \"bonus_amount\"  parameter.\n\n**Description:**\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://hackerone.com/reports/2082680 and see the right column of the screen and see the activity column's Bounty amount  \n ████\n\n## Impact\n\nConfidential  Information Disclosure",
