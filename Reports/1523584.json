WhatsApp status order updates should have been enabled first for the order from the primary number of the user. \n2. Order should not have been in the terminal state (not completed/cancelled).\n\nLimited Status updates were shown till the order was moved to a terminal state (cancelled/completed). Moreover, past events that were already published were not pushed again. \n\nApart from the order status updates (picked up, on the way, delivered), \n* It was not possible to view/extract any other information including user details\n* It was not possible to alter/update/cancel order\n\nRoot cause of this was due to missing early exit of the validation layer and caching overwrite on the flow that handled subscription request.\n\nThanks to @schutzx0r for responsibly disclosing this issue to us.\n",
