I went ahead and deactivated a Special Menu of @zomato's internal testing restaurant_id XXXXXX with menu_set_id\":XXXX which was active till 24th September. I apologised for the same to the team :(\n\n# POC\n\n- An attacker first needs to figure out these information like user_id, menu_set_id before deactivating any menus. For that we can issue a Post Request with correct var at\n\n> Request\n\n```\nPOST /XX/XXXXX?res_id=XXXXX HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.zomato.com\nX-Device-Is-Rooted: 0\nCookie: <COOKIES>\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\naccess_token=<your token>&client_id=zomato_ios_v2\n```\n\n- Since there was no restriction or a check to see if we actually hold that restaurant it leaked lots and lot's of useful stuff which was then chained with deleting the special menus of any restaurants.\n\n- Now using all this information, an attacker makes a Post Request at -\n\n> Request\n\n`XXX/XXXXX.php`\n\nwith var as `user_id=XXXX&type=SPECIAL&request_type=get-special-menus&res_id=XXXXX`\n\nthis gave some more useful information.\n\n- Now the final request was made by changing the request_type in the Post Parameters, since I obtained the menu_set_id in our above requests, I made a final request to deactivate/delete that from the restaurants.\n\nIn case you have any questions, please feel free to reach me on [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/prateek_0490). :)\n\nBest Regards,\nPrateek Tiwari",
