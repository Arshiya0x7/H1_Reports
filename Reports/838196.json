  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\nI found an outdated version of Telerik Web UI (v2016.2.607.40) at the following URL: https://███/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau.\nThis means that we can achieve full RCE by chaining two different CVEs: CVE-2017-11317, which allows us to upload arbitrary files on the server, and CVE-2019-18935, which is a deserialization vulnerability.\n\nFirst of all, the only thing that I tried to prove that I had successfully achieved code execution was making the server sleep for 10 seconds.\nNo data was compromised.\n\nSteps to reproduce\n---------------------\nThe steps that I followed are thoroughly described in this blog post: <https://know.bishopfox.com/research/cve-2019-18935-remote-code-execution-in-telerik-ui>.\nHere's a quick summary:\n- Download the files in the attachments\n- Make sure you have pycryptodome installed (pip3 install pycryptodome)\n- Run the following command: `python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -u https://█████/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau -v 2016.2.607.40 -f 'C:\\Windows\\Temp' -p sleep_042020163752,45_amd64.dll`\n- The `sleep_042020160430,40_amd64.dll` is supposed to Sleep(10). This will make the server hang for roughly ten seconds, and after that you will get a response like this one: `[*] Response time: 12.88 seconds`\n- The exploit worked.\n\nThings to note\n---------------------\nI had to edit the original exploit code provided in the aforementioned blog post (https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935) because I noticed that when uploading the .dll file the server added a .tmp at the end of the file name.\nThat's why the original code was failing to exploit the deserialization part.\nI added `+ '.tmp'` at the end of line 95 and after that it worked just fine.\n\nA DLL file can only work once. This means that to test the vulnerability again a new DLL has to be compiled.\nFor this reason I provided several DLLs in the attachments so you don't have to compile them (especially because a windows machine with Visual Studio installed is required).\n\nI didn't upload a reverse shell because I thought it was not a great idea, but if needed I could do it.\n\nHow to fix\n---------------------\nJust upgrade Telerik for ASP.NET AJAX to R3 2019 SP1 (v2019.3.1023) or later.\n\n## Impact\n\nFull **Remote Code Execution** on the vulnerable server.",
