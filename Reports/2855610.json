  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\n\nHello Team,\n\nDuring my research on admin.shopify.com, I discovered that if a customer is associated with a specific company and places an order for that company, but is later removed from the company, staff with restricted company permissions can still access and update the customer's information.\n\n## Shops Used to Test:\n████.myshopify.com\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Visit partner dashboard\n  2. Create development store or use existing one.\n  3. Login to admin.shopify.com.\n  4. Invite staff member and assign them Companies > View, Restrict permissions to assigned company locations and customers permissions.\n  5. Create a company and assign a customer to this company.\n  6. Create an order for the company created in step 5 from the customer's account.\n  7. Remove the customer from that company.\n  8. Try to place a personal order with different shipping address for the customer. \n  9. Visit the staff member account's customer tab and see the customer is still present with updated shipping address and is able to manage their personal information as well.\n\n## Impact\n\n## Summary:\n\nI think if a customer places an order for a company and is later removed from the company, only the order information should remain accessible to the staff. The customer's personal information, such as their shipping address or the ability to update their personal details, should no longer be accessible to ensure privacy.",

The issue arises when a customer, initially associated with a company and having placed an order, is later removed from that company. Despite the removal, staff with limited permissions can still view and manage the customer's personal information, including updated shipping addresses.",
