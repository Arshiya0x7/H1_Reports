  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**  I found a potential risk in the cloudFrontExtensionsConsole when I deployed it in the awslabs repository on GitHub. The application created functions and the roles of the functions had too many excessive permissions. A  malicious user could leverage these permissions to escalate his/her privilege in multiple ways.\n\n**Description:** First, the cloudFrontExtensionsConsole application created four functions that are cf_config_version_exporter, cf_config_version_manager, cf_config_version_manager_graphql, and cloudFrontExtensionsConso-SingletonLambdaf7d4f7304-ZbLF9YFgQ4eq rLambdaFunction. These functions share the same role which is cloudFrontExtensionsConso-CloudFrontConfigVersionCo-rAgdktzDTPRh. The role has the \"iam:CreateRole\", \"iam:GetRole\", \"iam:CreatePolicy\", and \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\" for \"*\" resources.  A  malicious user could leverage these permissions to escalate his/her privilege in multiple ways. For example, he/she can leverage the AttachRolePolicy permission to attach the AWS-managed policy or the policy created by the CreatePolicy to the role that he/she can access. It could allow a user to gain full administrator access to the AWS account.\n\nSecond, the cloudFrontExtensionsConsole application also created two functions that are cloudFrontExtensionsConso-RepoConstructSyncExtensi-ydrYwNGQCoFr and cloudFrontExtensionsConso-RepoConstructExtDeployer-1uHGWxrjog9S. These two functions share the same role which is cloudFrontExtensionsConso-RepoConstructExtDeployerR-wBEukYirZfbr. The role has the \"iam:*\" for \"*\" resources. These permissions can be exploited in more ways, including but not limited to the attack methods mentioned above.\n\nIn a word, the functions created by the cloudFrontExtensionsConsole have too many excessive permissions, which could cause very serious consequences.\n\n\n## Remediation Instructions\n1. Use finer-grained authorization roles to replace the way that many functions share one role. And use the specific resource names to replace the \"*\".\n2. The permissions for IAM resources should be removed if they do not affect normal functionality.\n3. Add a permissions boundary to restrict the permission.\n\n## Impact\n\n## Summary:\nA  malicious user could leverage these permissions to escalate his/her privilege.",
