  "vulnerability_information": "Summary:\nThe HTTP/2 proxy implementation in curl contains potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in buffer size calculations that could lead to memory corruption or denial of service.\n\nAI Usage Statement:\nThis report was prepared by a human security researcher after manual code review. No AI was used to generate this report.\n\nAffected Version:\nAll curl versions containing the HTTP/2 proxy implementation (since introduction of the feature). Tested with curl 8.6.0 on Linux x86_64.\nExamine the window size calculations in cf-h2-proxy.c:\n#define PROXY_H2_CHUNK_SIZE  (16*1024)\n#define H2_TUNNEL_WINDOW_SIZE        (10 * 1024 * 1024)\n#define PROXY_H2_NW_RECV_CHUNKS  (H2_TUNNEL_WINDOW_SIZE / PROXY_H2_CHUNK_SIZE)\n\n\nThe calculation H2_TUNNEL_WINDOW_SIZE / PROXY_H2_CHUNK_SIZE could overflow if either value is manipulated via malicious HTTP/2 frames.\n\nnghttp2_session_set_local_window_size(ctx->h2, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, 0,\n                                     PROXY_HTTP2_HUGE_WINDOW_SIZE);\nuses a 100MB window size (PROXY_HTTP2_HUGE_WINDOW_SIZE) which could lead to memory exhaustion.\n\n\nSupporting Material/References:\n\nThe vulnerable code is in lib/cf-h2-proxy.c in the curl source repository\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities have been found in other HTTP/2 implementations (CVE-2019-9511, CVE-2019-9513)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker controlling a malicious HTTP/2 proxy server could potentially:\n\nCause integer overflows leading to memory corruption\n\nTrigger resource exhaustion via extremely large window sizes\n\nCause denial of service through crafted window size advertisements\n\nThe impact is limited to:\n\nSystems using curl with HTTP/2 proxy support enabled\n\nWhen connecting to untrusted or compromised HTTP/2 proxies\n\nRequires the attacker to be in a MITM position or control the proxy server\n\nRecommended Fixes\nAdd bounds checking for window size calculations\n\nImplement reasonable maximum limits for window sizes\n\nAdd validation of window size advertisements from peers\n\nConsider using saturating arithmetic for size calculations\n\nAdditional Information\nThis vulnerability was discovered through manual code review focusing on integer handling in the HTTP/2 proxy implementation. The risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it requires proxy server compromise or MITM position, but the potential impact justifies addressing these issues.\n\nThe vulnerability shares characteristics with known HTTP/2 implementation flaws that have been exploited in other software (e.g., nghttp2, Apache HTTP Server).",
