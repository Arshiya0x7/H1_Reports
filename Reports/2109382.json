  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nHi team,\nHope you are doing well.I came across a disclosed report by hackerone (#2001913) wherein a researcher was able to create a support ticket on behalf of other users by sending fake email to support@hackerone.com. The issue was fixed by hackerone and sending email to support@hackerone.com does not create support tickets anymore.But,there is a bypass to this fix.\n**Description:**\nHackerone uses freshdesk as their third party service provider to handle support tickets .In freshdesk if a email is sent to support@domain.freshdesk.com it would create support tickets on behalf of the user.Similarly,if an email is sent to support@hackerone.freshdesk.com using a fake mailer like https://emkei.cz then a support ticket is  created by an attacker for the victim.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n1. Visit https://emkei.cz or any other fake mailer website.\n2. Put the victim email in from field and support@hackerone.freshdesk.com in the to field.\n3. Fill in the body with any message like account deletion and support ticket would be created in the behalf of victim and the support team will take it as legitimate request and process the request .\n\n### Mitigation:\n1.Freshdesk has a fix to the issue such that only emails sent to particular email address will only create tickets.The feature is called **Prevent Wildcard Ticket Create**.More deatils at https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/50000000652-receiving-spam-emails-to-support-domain-freshdesk-com-please-help-\n\n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n * Screenshot attached.██████\n* Check ticket **471406** created by me on a test account of mine.\n\n## Impact\n\n1.It is possible to perform sensitive action on behalf of victim .\n2.Ability to spam the support inbox thus increasing the wait time and leading to inconvenience for legitimate users.",
