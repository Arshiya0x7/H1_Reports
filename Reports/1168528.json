  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\n\nHello team, I hope you're doing well! App Search has a credentials page located at `/as#/credentials` that lists all the API keys a user has access to, if any. That same page will 404 for users with `Analyst` or `Editor` role. This is all working as intended, however there is also an [API endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/credentials.html) to query that same data at `/api/as/v1/credentials/` and this will list all existing API keys for any authenticated user regardless of their App Search role.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nI'm going to use the cloud environment for the reproduction\n\n### Preparation\n\n1. Log in App Search with the admin (`elastic`) user and go to the `Users & roles` page (`/as#/role-mappings/`)\n1. Click `Add mapping`\n1. In the `Attribute value` field enter `h1-repro`\n1. In the `Role` box select `Analyst`\n1. In the `Engine Access` select `Limited Engine Access`, no need to select any engine\n    - We now have created the most limited role possible\n1. Log in Kibana with the admin (`elastic`) user and go to the `Stack Management` > `Users` page (`/app/management/security/users/`)\n1. Click `Create user`\n1. In the `Username` field enter `hi-repro`\n1. Set any password you like and then click `Create user`\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Log in App Search with the `h1-repro` user\n1. Navigate to `/as#/role-mappings/` and observe that it's a 404 because you don't have access to this page\n1. Navigate to `/api/as/v1/credentials/` and observe that you have access to all the API keys\n\n## Impact\n\nPrivilege escalation. The default App Search install has a [Private API Key with read/write access to all engines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/authentication.html#authentication-key-types). If a Private Admin Key has been created before. the attacker can use it to create new API keys or delete existing ones.",
