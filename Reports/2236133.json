  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nI've discovered a significant security flaw in cURL's file handling, particularly affecting the HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) database when handling long filenames. \n\n### Vulnerability Description\ncURL erroneously creates temporary files with names potentially exceeding the filesystem's maximum filename length (typically 255 bytes for ext4, etc.). If a filename used in the HSTS database is longer than 243 bytes (255 bytes minus 9 for the random suffix and 4 for the '.tmp' extension), an unexpected security error occurs, leading to the HSTS database being overwritten.\n\n### Affected Code\n\n**File: curl/lib/fopen.c**\n```c\nCURLcode Curl_fopen(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *filename, FILE **fh, char **tempname) {\n  CURLcode result = CURLE_WRITE_ERROR;\n  unsigned char randsuffix[9]; // Random suffix generation <=======\n  ...\n  tempstore = aprintf(\"%s.%s.tmp\", filename, randsuffix); // Temporary filename creation <=======\n  if(!tempstore) {\n    result = CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY;\n    goto fail;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**File: curl/lib/hsts.c**\n```c\nresult = Curl_fopen(data, file, &out, &tempstore);\n...\nif(!result && tempstore && Curl_rename(tempstore, file)) // Attempt to rename temp file to actual file <======\n  result = CURLE_WRITE_ERROR;\n\nif(result && tempstore)\n  unlink(tempstore); // Remove temp file if error occurs\n```\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n\nFirst let’s check the correct behaviour. I’ve created simple hsts file for cxsecurity.com domain\n```bash\n$ cat ok.hsts.txt\n# Your HSTS cache. https://curl.se/docs/hsts.html\n# This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.\ncxsecurity.com \"20241031 12:12:12\"\n                                                                                                                                                  \n$ curl --hsts ok.hsts.txt http://cxsecurity.com -v\n* Switched from HTTP to HTTPS due to HSTS => https://cxsecurity.com/\n*   Trying 188.114.97.1:443...\n… \n```\n\nSo works great. Let’s try update the database and add Facebook \n  \n```bash\n$ curl --hsts ok.hsts.txt https://facebook.com -v \n*   Trying 31…\n* Connected to facebook.com …\n…\n< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; preload\n…\n                                                                                                                                                                  \n$ cat ok.hsts.txt                                \n# Your HSTS cache. https://curl.se/docs/hsts.html\n# This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.\ncxsecurity.com \"20241031 12:12:12\"\nfacebook.com \"20240430 00:11:44\"\n```\n\nThe file has been successfully updated.   \n\nLet’s see what will happen if the user will define filename longer that 243 (let’s use the content from previous file)\n\n```bash\n$ cp ok.hsts.txt hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.txt \n```\n\nLet’s validate the file size as it will be important to prove security issue. \n\n```bash\n$ ls -la hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.txt          \n-rw-r--r-- 1 cx cx 179 Nov  1 19:14 hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.txt\n```\n\nwe have 179 bytes.\n\nIf the user will use such file, curl will reset the content due to improper rename action\n\n```bash\n$ cat hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.hsts.txt\n# Your HSTS cache. https://curl.se/docs/hsts.html\n# This file was generated by libcurl!

Looking forward to your response.\n\n## Impact\n\nBypass HSTS",
