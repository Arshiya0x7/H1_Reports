  "vulnerability_information": "Theses reports spreads other several years and are all about **HTTP Smuggling issues**\n(HTTP Requests or Responses splitting, Cache Poisoning, Security filter bypass).\nI've made reports on a wide range of open source projects, explaining\nthe (not always easy) problems to the various security maintainers and testing the fixs.\n\nThe starting point for this work was the 2005 work published by Amit Klein and some others:\n\n * 2004 - Amit Klein : \"Divide and Conquer: HTTP Response Splitting, Web Cache Poisoning Attacks, and Related Topics\" https://packetstormsecurity.com/papers/general/whitepaper_httpresponse.pdf\n * 2005 - Chaim Linhart, Amit Klein, Ronen Heled, Steve Orrin: \"HTTP Request Smuggling\" https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf\n * 2006 - Amit Klein: \"HTTP Message Splitting, Smuggling and Other Animals\" www.owasp.org/images/1/1a/OWASPAppSecEU2006_HTTPMessageSplittingSmugglingEtc.ppt \n * 2005 - Amit Klein: \"HTTP Request Smuggling - ERRATA (the IIS 48K buffer phenomenon)\" \n * 2006 - Amit Klein: “HTTP Response Smuggling” https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/425593\n * 2006 - Amit Klein : HTTP Response Smuggling http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2006-February/000836.html\n * RFC 7230 section 9 (splitting, parsing, smuggling, poisoning) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9\n\nAnd also the works of James Kettle on HTTP Host headers \"Practical HTTP Host header attacks (Absolute uri in host headers)\"\nhttps://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html\nand, later, his work on ESI server or pingbacks and cache attacks or Pratical Web Cache Poisoning.\n\nIn 2015, Starting from these past studies, I studied **Apache**, **Nginx**, **Varnish** source code, I discovered\nthat a lot of smuggling problems were still present, found new ones based on overflows for the size\nattributes (previous works were mostly based on doubling length information) and expanded my works on\n**Golang**, **Nodejs**, **pound**, **HaProxy**, **Jetty**, **Tomcat**, **Apache Traffic Server**...\n\nI sometime had to push for disclosure of fixed vulnerabilitie (Varnish 3) via bugtraq.\nBut in most of the case it's been a matter a patience -- the long time between reports and fixes\nha also something to deal with lazyness on my side as security is not the biggest part of my job --\nas most of the fix implies updates on HTTP servers, which is not something as fast as updating a web\napplication framework. I did not get a security report or a CVE for each reported flaw, especially\non the first years. Smuggling is sometimes hard to explain (and public disclosure policies\nare not always liked on HTTP servers dev teams).\n\nThe main problem of HTTP smuggling issues is that the final exploitation comes from **interactions between different http parsers**. If two actors badly interprets the HTTP message or disagree on the right\ninterpretation then bad things could happen. From the security maintainer point of view it's sometimes\neasy to reject the problem as coming from the others.\n\nIt's also **very important** to understand that the attacker controls the HTTP message, **we do not use HTTP messages from browsers**, the attacker injects bad HTTP messages onto servers infrastructures, effects on the users comes later, when the real user HTTP messages reach the *infected* or  *shaken* servers. *Like when you do report a smuggling issue on hackerone reports, they prevent reporters that issues about header injection are not always security issues because we cannot control the user headers. That's a huge misunderstanding of smuggling payloads*.\n\nI've made some blog posts explaining details (I still have one awaiting vendor authorization) for some\nof the fixed problems.\n\nAnd I also made a **Defcon 24** presentation on 2016. For someone knowing nothing on smuggling\nit's a good starting point (links on next part below).\n\nNote : my work is usually reported with the name 'regilero', and sometimes 'Régis Leroy'.\n\n# Public ressources published\n\n * 2015 : Nginx Integer truncation : https://regilero.github.io/english/security/2015/03/25/nginx-integer_truncation/\n * 2015 : Checking HTTP Smuggling issues in 2015 – Part1 http://regilero.github.io/security/english/2015/10/04/http_smuggling_in_2015_part_one \n * 2016 : Defcon 24 : Hiding Wookiees in HTTP: HTTP smuggling https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2024/DEF%20CON%2024%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2024%20-%20Regilero-Hiding-Wookiees-In-Http.pdf\n    - Defcon presentation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVU9i5PsMPY\n    - Defcon demos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY_Mf2Fv7kI  (which were not available on time due to Linux not supported by Defcon !!)\n * 2018 : HTTP Smuggling, Apsis Pound load balancer : https://regilero.github.io/english/security/2018/07/03/security_pound_http_smuggling/\n * 2019 : HTTP Smuggling, Jetty : https://regilero.github.io/english/security/2019/04/24/security_jetty_http_smuggling/\n \nTools: HTTPWookiee : https://github.com/regilero/HTTPWookiee : this contains a small subset of the real tests I perform on HTTP servers.\n\n# List of CVEs\n\n## Apache Traffic Server\n\n * **CVE-2018-8004** : space before colon + force connection close on error 400 + duplicate Content-Lenght issues + bad parsing of request size on cache hit\n\n## Jetty\n\n * **CVE-2017-7656** : HTTP/0.9 Request Smuggling\n  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7656 (score 6.5)\n\n * **CVE-2017-7657**: Transfer-Encoding Request Smuggling\n  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7657 (score 6.5)\n\n * **CVE-2017-7658**: Too Tolerant Parser, Double Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding + Whitespace \n  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7658 (score 6.5)\n\n\n# Apache httpd\n\n * https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57832 : Apache issues on 'socket poisoning', where we could store HTTP responses on\n  the reverse proxy by sending extra responses, and mix these response with other users later. Not fixed via a CVE because this behavior\n  was not considered as a real security issue (it's a consequence of a successful splitting attack on the backend, or of a compromised backend).\n  If you ask my opinion this is one of the most problematic issue I found on these 5 years.

This was in my mind quite huge.\n * https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/1014 : wontfix : I'd like an error 400 instead of silently ignoring a bad header, no success\n\n# OpenBSD\n\nIn 2015 the OpenBSD Http server was very new, crashing on 0.9 requests, I reported some smuggling issues (bad end of line, double Content-Length) which were fixed later.\n\n# HaProxy\n\nHaProxy was transmitting some of the very bad request I use to perform splitting attacks on backends (something which is not a security issue, but which allows security issues).\nI had various discussions with Willy Tarreau which leaded to some improvments in HaProxy, blocking bad requests before any less robust HTTP parser could read it.\n\nFor example:\n\n * commit 987aa383c85525b163267110a4bcff4dff3849b8 : BUG/MEDIUM: http: remove content-length from chunked messages\n * commit e1ce063c12bf22b99e6caa6a55484f1b9a27e113 : MEDIUM: http: disable support for HTTP/0.9 by default\n * commit b053c03d6f05c8ddf264de78fe321d8455358690 : MEDIUM: http: restrict the HTTP version token to 1 digit as per RFC7230\n\n# Summary\n\nI think this work allows for more robusts HTTP servers. Some of the very old issues already reported in the 2005 era reports, like double Content Length,\nwere still widely supported in 2015 and are now harder to find on most open source http servers. I think I contributed greatly to enforce the RFC 7230\nanti-smuggling policies (chunk priority, no double content-length) and for the removal of old-rfc dangerous features (like the continuation of headers\nwith the space prefix, or the HTTP/0.9 support). For this I just had to read the 2005 studies and the RFC, tests the servers, and try to explain\nexploitations.\n\nA big part of my added work and reports was studying effects of control characters (\\r, \\n, NULL, vtab, htab, bell, backspace & formfeed) on various parts of the messages.\nWith some real good success on vartious project for NULL or for bad enf of lines.\nAnother big thing was studying the HTTP/0.9 downgrade exploitations (like extracting a valid HTTP message stored in an image from a partial 0.9 response) and\nfinding new 0.9 downgrade vectors.\nFinally another part of this work was finding new attack vectors (truncation of size, overflows, concatenation of strings, effects of cache hit on header parsing, etc).\n\nThe last big part of my work was spending a long time explaining the potential attacks to maintainers. If you need hints from people understanding the smuggling attacks\nand the implications of the fixed flaws, usually better than the project maintainers, I could give you some names. If you need samples of reports or detailled lab exploitations I could also deliver.\n\nHTTP/2 or TLS are not preventing bad effects of HTTP/1.1 bad parsers (they embed HTTP/1.1 parsers in another layer), nor they could prevent effects of an HTTP/0.9 downgrades.\nEvery HTTP actors which enforces a more robust protocol parsing prevents chaining effects of smuggling attacks.\nSo I hope the work I made on the subject had real effects on the ecosystem.\n\nSome of these CVE were already elected for bounties:\n- Verizon: undisclosed (#433076): 2 700 USD\n- Apache httpd CVE-2016-8743 : https://hackerone.com/reports/244459 : 1500 USD\n- FaceBook Proxygen: (bugcrowd) 1000 USD\n- Golang CVE-2015-5739 &CVE-2015-5740 : Google Security Bounty program : 1337 USD\n\n## Impact\n\nFor the final user the consequences may be huge:\n- Cache poisoning : so effects starts at Deny of Service, but may go to code injection (like replacing\n the code of a well known js library)\n- Credentials hijacking : one of the smuggling exploitation is storing unterminated requests and waiting\n for other users requests to terminate the pending requests, mixing the users credentials on something\n they did not requested (hijacking users credentials). But this cannot work on applications using csrf protections.\n- a lot of Deny of Service attacks, one of the attacks allows mixing requests and responses of\n different users, so you have documents requested by others, and they have yours.\n- security filter bypass: here the public effect is less important, the attacker use smuggling to\n remove some of the security layers\n\nA massive scale smuggling attack on a big actor (a cloud provider for example) could make a huge DOS.\nA more realist usage with a public consequence is a targeted cache poisoning, to inject an XSS.\nAn advanced usage is the filter bypass usage, where the smuggled requests is usually not even logged. A prefect way of sending requests without notices, so a nice tool for SSRF exploits.",
