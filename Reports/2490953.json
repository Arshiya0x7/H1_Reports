  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:** Recently you allowed us to give testimonials for the sandbox reports which is Vulnerable and allows all the researcher to control their  **Testimonials** for their benefit t.\n\n**Description:**\nWhen a report is closed as resolved we are given the option of \"This hacker is eligible for a testimonial\" in the Sandbox report and if we fill out this form and submit it for our own Profile and then go to our profile setting \"https://hackerone.com/settings/feedback\" and turn on \"Show this blurb on my profile\" On then this Testimonial will be shown in our Public Profile of Hackerone.\n\nWith a Single Sandbox Program I can create more than 50 Testimonials for myself that I have Hacked and I am a good hacker.\nHere the Credibility of the Hackeron testimonial system will fail completely as the Other users can only see that a Private program gave them a review and don't know which program or a Sandbox Program.\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. With your second ID create a Sandbox Program  and Invite your active ID to that Program\n2. with the Active ID Create a Few reports for your own Sandbox Program\n3.

      "content": "This vulnerability allows hackers to create and display self-authored testimonials on their public profiles. The issue arises when a hacker creates a sandbox program on HackerOne and invites an alternate account. The alternate account can then submit reports to the sandbox program, and the primary account, acting as the program owner, can resolve these reports. Upon resolution, the program owner is presented with an option to provide a testimonial for the hacker who submitted the report. By filling out this testimonial form and enabling the \"Show this blurb on my profile\" setting, the hacker can display the self-authored testimonial on their public HackerOne profile.\n\nWe came to the decision to score this as Medium (5.3) due to the fact that this impacts the Integrity of the testimonial system as modification of data is possible. The hacker does not have complete control over testimonials however as they only work to show feedback from \"a private team\" (i.e. their own Private Sandbox Program) and not any actual team.\n\nAs a result of this report, our team implemented a fix to prevent creation of a hacker review (Testimonial) when a team is sandboxed, and introduced more extensive access control checking to ensure that only legitimate testimonials can be written. We've also removed the false testimonials created out of this exercise. The hacker completed a retest and confirmed that the issue is no longer present.\n\n",
