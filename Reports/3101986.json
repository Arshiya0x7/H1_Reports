  "vulnerability_information": "hey team\nA UI issue allows a user to upload or add documents to a folder they should not have access to. This bypasses intended permissions and could lead to unauthorized access or data integrity issues.\n\nsteps to reproduce: \n1- login in account a which is the admin, add any document to the folder\n2-login as account b which is member and go to the same folder then click on add multiple documents and choose any document\n3-the document will be uploaded successfully, the button of adding looks disabled but it works fine, the member is not supposed to do this function\n\n█████████\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue constitutes an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. Although the UI is intended to restrict access, users can manipulate the client-side behavior to perform unauthorized actions — in this case, uploading documents to folders they shouldn't have access to. This breaks access control at the object level and could allow:\n\nUnauthorized insertion of documents into restricted folders",
