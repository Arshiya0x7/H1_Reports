The vulnerability was due to unrestricted invitations on sandbox programs which allowed an attacker to generate an infinite number of bounced emails. We had applied a fix by limiting program invites in sandbox programs, but it was an incomplete fix as demonstrated by @iamr000t.\n\n*Why Limited Disclosure?*\nWe don't usually limit disclosure, but there were a lot of emotional responses and far too much to redact that would have made it difficult to follow the report.",

No, RFC 5322 verification while sending invites.\n\nI used a simple payload that was \"anyemail$1@anything.com\" and sent an email invitation, and to my surprise the email was accepted and invitation was sent however according to RFC5322 email like that can not actually exist\nbecause HackerOne uses AWS SES for emailing services as an attacker I could have used this issue to terminate HackerOne's SES account .\nAlthough after reporting this issue my report was first marked as not applicable and a duplicate to Email Spamming (all thanks to my lack of report writing skills I guess) and due to some misunderstandings and miscommunications  I later on did some damage and my report was marked as ineligible for bounty. although the issue was valid and fixed (closed as resolved ) and I learnt a lot about testing for DoS attacks safely so it is a win win for everybody.\n\n###Lesson Learnt: Always test for DoS attacks carefully & Follow the Bend but not break approach \nLink To the full writeup :\nhttps://medium.com/@NinadMishra/dos-and-bugbounties-a-series-of-dos-attacks-on-hackerone-9c8316e192c9",
