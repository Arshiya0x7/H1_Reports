Truly awesome, the next day I retested after the first fix, and found that I\n\n- Cannot receive the email confirmation in the email used to sign up\n- Cannot integrate across stores/partner even they share the same email address after confirming them\n\nAnd the report was later resolved after I verified the fix.\n\nFor some reason, I decided to test again to see what's something new that I can find.\n\nThen I found user can change their email prior to receiving the verification message on their original email. i.e. the same technique, I don't know what went wrong in my first retest, but Shopify security and engineering team again showed their professionalism, quickly resolving the second comments I left in ~3.5 hrs.\n\nAnd when I thought this is the end of story, I later received a comment asking me to open a new report about the second retest, and here I am writing this report.\n\nThanks,\nRon\n\n## Impact\n\n.",
