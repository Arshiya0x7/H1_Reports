  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nI have selected the asset hackerone.com because of the support.hackerone.com is not an accepted bug for bounty but I believe this bug should be fixed by HackerOne with Freshdesk.\n\n**Description:**\nWe need to open a support ticket from this URL https://support.hackerone.com/support/tickets/new.\nTo open the ticket system doesn't need to require any authentication. If I have the email address & username of H1 account, I can request a support ticket for the H1 account.\nAfter requesting the support ticket, H1 support agent takes action accordingly.\nTo test I opened a support ticket 460752. I requested to delete my account even I didn't open any account on support.hackerone.com\nThe support agent already processed the request & forwarded it to the relevant department.\nThe design of the system is not secure. Anyone may open a support ticket for my account & if the agent processes it accordingly it's may lead an authorized action for my account. Hackers may also do spamming with this, and even H1 also may suspend the H1 account for that.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open this link https://support.hackerone.com/support/tickets/new\n2. Create a support ticket with the target account's email address & h1 username.\n\n**Recommendation**\nThe support system design should be changed. To open a support ticket user should register here https://support.hackerone.com then need to create the support ticket. Otherwise, there needs an email verification step with OTP to open a support request without login.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis bug may cause of Unauthorized Action by H1 support agent. Anyone may start spamming by using an H1 user's information.",
