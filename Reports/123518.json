Clicking on the link takes him to a website where certain JavaScript is executed which steals his Id and password (SESSION COOKIE). The results can be more dangerous.\n\n<?php\n$to = \"VICTIM@example.com\";\n$subject = \"Password Change\";\n$txt = \"Change your password by visiting here -\n[VIRUS LINK HERE]\";\n$headers = \"From: security@veris.in\";\nmail($to,$subject,$txt,$headers);\n?>\n\nFix :\n\nYour SPF record is:\nFound v=spf1 record for veris.in:\nv=spf1 include:servers.mcsv.net ?all \n\nIt should be\n\nFound v=spf1 record for veris.in:\nv=spf1 include:servers.mcsv.net -all \n\nI strongly recommend you to read this article :\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-an-spf-record-to-prevent-spoofing-improve-e-mail-reliability\n\nYou can check your SPF here:\n\nhttp://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html\n\nThe problem :\n\nThe article clearly shows difference between softfail and fail you should be using fail as Softfail allows anyone to send spoofed emails from your domains. in your SPF record you should replace ~ with - at last before all , - is strict which prevents all spoofed emails except if you are sending.
