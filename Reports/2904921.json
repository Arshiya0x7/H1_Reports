  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary**\nThe Bandit tool flagged the usage of the ``subprocess``module in the file ``curl.py``under the **B404:blacklist rule**. This rule highlights potential security risks associated with using the subprocess module without proper sanitization of inputs, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThe specific issue appears in the code where subprocess.Popen and subprocess.run are used to execute system-level commands. If user inputs or other untrusted data are passed directly into these subprocess calls without validation, this can allow malicious actors to inject arbitrary commands, potentially compromising the security of the system.\n\n**Affected Code**\nThe flagged code occurs in the curl.py file as follows:\n\nimport subprocess\n\n``# Code where subprocess is used to execute system commands``\n``p = subprocess.Popen(args, stderr=cerr, stdout=cout,``\n                 ``    cwd=self._run_dir, shell=False, env=self._run_env)``\n\n``p = subprocess.run(args, stderr=cerr, stdout=cout,``\n                   ``cwd=self._run_dir, shell=False,``\n                   ``input=intext.encode() if intext else None,``\n                  `` timeout=self._timeout,``\n                   ``env=self._run_env)``\n\n**Location in the file:**\nFile: ``curl.py``\n\n**Explanation of the Vulnerability**\nThe subprocess module provides a way to spawn new processes and interact with them. While it is powerful, it also poses a security risk if used improperly. Specifically:\n\n**Command Injection**: If the arguments passed to ``subprocess.Popen`` or ``subprocess.run`` include untrusted user input, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands, leading to the execution of malicious code on the system.\n**Improper Input Handling**: The code does not sanitize or validate the inputs passed to these subprocess functions. This leaves the system open to attacks if any of the input parameters (``args``, ``intext``, etc.) can be manipulated by untrusted sources.\n\nIn the affected code, ``args`` and ``intext`` are passed directly into subprocess calls. If these inputs are derived from user input, environment variables, or external sources without validation, an attacker could craft malicious input that would be executed by the subprocess, leading to a potential security breach.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Command Injection**: An attacker could inject arbitrary system commands into the args or intext variables. These injected commands would be executed with the privileges of the process running the Python code.\n**Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: In the worst case, if the application is running with elevated privileges (e.g., root or administrator), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to full remote code execution.\n**Denial of Service (DoS)**: If an attacker provides a command that causes the system to crash or hang, this could lead to a denial of service, affecting the availability of the system or application.",
