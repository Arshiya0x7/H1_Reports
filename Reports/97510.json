  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nThere appears to be a bug similar to #95243 which affects following a user after favoriting one of their tweets via an Intent dialog.\n\nThe following is a proof of concept:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/favorite/?tweet_id=661625230297821184&screen_name=ericrtest3\n\nThe screen_name param submits with the favorite form and ends up getting injected into the follow param on the resulting page.\n\nThis isn't quite as bad as the previous vulnerability I found, since it requires an additional step (favoriting a tweet) to exploit. However, the impact is exactly the same as the last vulnerability, in that the user has no idea that they're actually following a completely different user.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.",
