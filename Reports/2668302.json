  "vulnerability_information": "A removed guest role user, who no longer has access to private projects, is still able to view jobs associated with those projects. This issue indicates a potential security gap where access controls may not be effectively enforced after user removal.\n\nSummary \nIn the scenario where a user with a guest role is removed from a private project, their access should be completely revoked. However, in this case, despite the removal, the user can still view job details associated with the private project. This behavior suggests a flaw in the access control mechanism, allowing unauthorized visibility of sensitive project-related information.\n\nSteps to reproduce \n1 Invite a guest role user to a private project through the owner account \n2 Through guest role user access the job as raw format \n>https://cdn.artifacts.gitlab-static.net/f3/93/id \n\n\n3 After Owner remove him from private project but still the link is accessible to him \nwithout having access to private project and that particular team \nThat can disclose him some sensitive info such ( env , sensitive docker images , crtitical information to him ) \n\nMitigations \nEnsure that the system correctly enforces access controls and revokes all permissions for removed users. This may involve auditing and enhancing the user role management and permission handling processes.\n\nIf you have any more more questions \nComment on the report \n\nRegards \n@mrrobot\n\n## Impact\n\nAs an attacker \nRemoved users gaining access to job details can expose sensitive project data or operational information. This could lead to inadvertent or malicious leakage of internal processes and project specifics.",
