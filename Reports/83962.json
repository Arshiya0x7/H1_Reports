This map is cached globally, and is populated even if the\ncontroller class doesn't actually exist.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 4-1-wildcard_route.patch - Patch for 4.1 series\n* 4-2-wildcard_route.patch - Patch for 4.2 series\n\nPlease note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.",
