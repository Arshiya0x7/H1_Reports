  "vulnerability_information": "Oniguruma [1] by K. Kosako is a BSD licensed regular expression library that supports a variety of character encodings. The Ruby programming language, in version 1.9, as well as PHP's multi-byte string module (since PHP5), use Oniguruma as their regular expression engine. It is also used in products such as Atom, Take Command Console, Tera Term, TextMate, Sublime Text and SubEthaEdit.\n\nWe've identified six remote memory corruption issues in Oniguruma that affect the latest stable release v6.2.0 and the develop branch, they have received upstream patch in the latest stable version v6.3.0; PHP upstream has now included 5 of the patches (CVE-2017-9224, CVE-2017-9226, CVE-2017-9227, CVE-2017-9228, CVE-2017-9229) that are applicable to the mbstring module [2, 3]. The regular expression APIs may be exposed to regular expressions from the network, potentially allow remote exploitation or denial of service in products that use Oniguruma, such as when used in PHP5/7 and Ruby.\n\n[1] https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma\n[2] https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/20eacb787f4543604f3c657e191baf274bb943c2\n[3] https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/bee52f352f00d86593bef43ed4cec4dbfd9edfcf\n\nCVE-2017-9226: Heap Out-of-bounds Write\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption. Upstream issue report, fix and PHP commits as below:\n\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/55\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/f015fbdd95f76438cd86366467bb2b39870dd7c6\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/b4bf968ad52afe14e60a2dc8a95d3555c543353a\nhttps://github.com/php/php-src/commit/1e0c4386ab87c6f6392933450130470cbd1a2b19\n\nCVE-2017-9224: Stack Out-of-bounds Read\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer. Upstream issue report, fix and PHP commits as below:\n\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/57\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/690313a061f7a4fa614ec5cc8368b4f2284e059b\nhttps://github.com/php/php-src/commit/60b1829e1cd18facc696264fd830c4bbd593cfa9\n\nCVE-2017-9227: Invalid Dereference, Denial-of-Service\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression searching. Invalid handling of reg->dmin in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer. Upstream issue report, fix and PHP commits as below:\n\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/58\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/9690d3ab1f9bcd2db8cbe1fe3ee4a5da606b8814\nhttps://github.com/php/php-src/commit/6a8ae7cf8db3ec8dabfd027e01cdbcbb52654c90\n\nCVE-2017-9228: Uninitialized Variable, Out-of-bounds Write\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption. Upstream issue report, fix and PHP commits as below:\n\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/60\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/3b63d12038c8d8fc278e81c942fa9bec7c704c8b\nhttps://github.com/php/php-src/commit/1c845d295037702d63097e2216b3c5db53f79273\n\nCVE-2017-9229: Denial-of-Service\nAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A SIGSEGV occurs in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression compilation. Invalid handling of reg->dmax in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate denial-of-service condition. Upstream issue report, fix and PHP commits as below:\n\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/59\nhttps://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/b690371bbf97794b4a1d3f295d4fb9a8b05d402d\nhttps://github.com/php/php-src/commit/5416deec665db293ae25548828791453d776a6bf\n\n\n\n\n",
