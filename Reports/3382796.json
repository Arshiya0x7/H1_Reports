  "vulnerability_information": "Hello Twitch Security Team,\n\nMy name is █████* and I can be reached at **████**. I am reporting a potential information disclosure issue I discovered which appears to be related to a publicly-listable S3 bucket containing configuration and JSON files.\n\n**Summary (short):**\nPublicly-listable S3 bucket (`█████`) returning an XML `ListBucketResult` with multiple JSON/config files (e.g., `███`, `███████`, `██████████`). The bucket listing and file metadata are retrievable without authentication. See attached curl output for exact results. \n\n**Files observed (examples from the listing):**\n\n* `███████` (LastModified: ████07T19███)\n* `████` (LastModified: █████07T19███████)\n* `█████`, `███`, `████████`, `██████`\n  (Full curl/█████████output attached). \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n1. From an internet-connected host, request the bucket listing (example command used to obtain attached output replace host if needed):\n\n```bash\ncurl ███\n```\n\n2. The server responds with an S3 `ListBucketResult` XML containing `Contents` entries for multiple JSON/config files (see attached output). \n\n**Observed raw output:**\n(See attached file `curl`/XML output showing `ListBucketResult` and the `Contents` entries). \n\n████\n\n**Suggested severity:** Medium (information disclosure).\n\n* If the JSON files contain secrets or PII, severity rises to High/Critical. I have not inspected object contents beyond the listing; this report covers the fact that the bucket is listable/publicly discoverable. You may want to check the objects' contents for sensitive fields.\n\n**Recommended remediation / next steps:**\n\n1. Verify whether the bucket should be publicly listable. If not, restrict `ListBucket` permissions and require appropriate authentication (AWS IAM or presigned URLs) for object listing and retrieval.\n2. Review object ACLs and S3 bucket policy; remove any `Allow` statements that permit anonymous `s3:ListBucket` or `s3:GetObject` if unintended.\n3. Rotate any credentials/secrets found inside these files (if any) and perform an audit for exposure.\n4. Consider adding a blocking rule for public indexing (e.g., block public access at account/bucket level) and implement least-privilege access.\n5. If objects must be publicly available, ensure they contain no secrets or PII and consider serving through a hardened CDN and obfuscated paths rather than a listable bucket.\n\n**PGP / sensitive data:**\nIf you prefer to exchange the contents of sensitive files or any reproduction artifacts via encrypted email, please let me know and I will follow up with your PGP key or a secure channel.\n\n**Disclosure / recognition:**\nI would appreciate recognition for this responsible disclosure. Please list me as **██████████** (that is my handle) if you include contributors in any acknowledgements.\n\nThank you for your time happy to provide any additional details (object contents I retrieved, timestamps, or full curl output) if you request them via a secure channel. Please let me know a case/ticket number or expected timeline for remediation if possible.\n\nBest regards,\n████*\nHandle: **████████**\nEmail: ██████\n\n## Impact\n\n**Impact / Why this is a concern:**\n\n* The bucket exposes internal configuration and versioned JSON files which may leak internal API endpoints, configuration parameters, feature flags, or other operational details useful to an attacker.\n* Filenames and timestamps (example: `█████` last modified ██████████07T19████████) are visible which can help fingerprint versions and rollout timelines. \n* Depending on the contents of these JSON files (if they contain credentials, tokens, or PII), the impact could be high. Even if files are only config/feature flags, that may still weaken security posture.",
