  "vulnerability_information": "Summary:\nOAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application. Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application. This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of their account to a third party.\n\nThe basic OAuth process is widely used to integrate third-party functionality that requires access to certain data from a user's account. For example, an application might use OAuth to request access to your email contacts list so that it can suggest people to connect with. However, the same mechanism is also used to provide third-party authentication services, allowing users to log in with an account that they have with a different websites. \n \nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Signup with oauth method in reddit.com\n2. Then logout the account \n3. Then login with the same Gmail account\n4. What happens here is, now the attacker can easily log in using the victim's account which bypasses the verification methods.\n\nFor fixing this issue:\nEither don't let user enter with oauth when there's already another account created with the same email or let the user enter but let him know someone else has already created an account and if it was him or not then ask him to change the password.\n\n## Impact\n\nOnly one thing we need here and that is email address. Just by knowing that we can takeover victim's account so the impact here is quite high. Imagine email address is something you can even get if you ask so its not a hard task. But since the oauth does not authenticates the real user attackers can easily takeover the account.",
