  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nThe online shop at https://book-bar.shopify.io/ appears to be for a shopify employee summit. On this site, with no promo code, any user can checkout books for free. I only did one in the PoC (Feel free to cancel that or tell me how to). It appeared that I was able to put as many books as was available in my cart to checkout. So an anonymous user could claim all the product.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n  1. Browse to https://book-bar.shopify.io/\n  2. Select a book that is not sold out, and add it to your cart\n  3. Fill out shipping information, no payment info is needed, and confirm the checkout\n  4. You will see a \"Thank you for your purchase\" screen confirming your FREE selection. \n\n## Supporting Material:\nPlease see the attached video of me being able to add \"Sapiens\" to my cart, and checkout for free. (Also, feel free to cancel the transaction!)\n\n ## Video PoC\n██████\n\n## Impact\n\n## Summary:\nAn anonymous user can claim all the books and free merchandise, and essentially empty out the entire shop and ship it for free.",

The shop was set up for testing with placeholder prices of $0 and was password protected except during testing and for Shopify events. After testing, the password was enabled or disabled to indicate whether or not the shop was currently open for orders from event attendees.\n\nThis report describes finding the shop when the password was disabled during testing and the reporter was able to place orders for books that appeared to be free.\n\nShopify closed this report as informative because there was no risk that orders placed by someone for free books would have been fulfilled. The key factors that informed this decision are:\n\n1. The shop was intended to be publicly available for periods of time.\n2. Because Shopify had a process in place to manually verify orders prior to submitting them to the book vendor, any orders that were placed by the public or during testing, when placeholder prices were set at $0, would have been and were identified and cancelled prior to fulfillment.",
