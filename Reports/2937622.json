  "vulnerability_information": "## Description\nHello, team! I hope this report finds you well. I identified a shared GitHub profile for the HackerOne-managed triage team at ███. It contains 44 public repositories, many of which were recently created:\n██████████\nSince this is a shared managed triage account, I thought that it could possibly be used to reproduce vulnerabilities for HackerOne-managed bug bounty programs. I did a quick look at the recent repos, and I discovered quite a few *(active?)* related to HackerOne bug bounty programs:\n- ███/tester/blob/main/a.js looks like an exploitation script for IDOR at █████. ██████████ has a private h1-managed bug bounty program.\n- By looking at the last commit in the █████ branch for ███████/edge-runtime, we can find a new file uploaded █████ with an exploit for access token, server URL, and secret leak for ██████'s edge runtime CLI tool ███████. ███ has a private h1-managed bug bounty program.\n- Code execution in powertools for ██████████ lambda Java ████/clone-█████ by referring to an executable in the configuration file ‎pom.xml. ████ ██████ has a private h1-managed bug bounty program.\n- ██████: secrets leak from GitHub actions by injecting a command to .github/workflows/pr-build.yml and creating PR █████. ██████████ has a private/public h1-managed bug bounty programs.\n\nI also identified a few personal GitHub profiles for the HackerOne-managed triage ██████████. Here's a random report's commit: █████/setup-chain-node/commit/█████████ *(and another fresh commit called \"Retest,\" meaning the issue is potentially fixed)*, which is a GitHub actions injection into █████'s repository. I can't confirm if █████ has a HackerOne program, but it likely ████ is a fork of ██████████/dynamic-config for PR. The latest commit ████████ injects the preinstall command for package.json to execute script in github runner and leak secrets for ████████'s repository. ████████ has a managed HackerOne bug bounty █████: No public █████████: No public ██████. The GitHub token leak from GitHub actions for ███████ SDK for JavaScript is via ██████/█████████-sdk-js-duplicate/pull/2/files. █████████ █████ has a private h1-managed bug bounty ███ *(now ████)*: Recent POC for █████ E2E encryption vulnerability ████/. ████ has a public h1-managed bug bounty ██████. Env vars leak from GitHub actions at ██████████/backstage/commit/███ for Backstage.\n\nThese are the only HackerOne-managed individual profiles I stumbled upon. I can try to bruteforce some more.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n- Even if public repo creation is needed for vulnerability reproduction *(for example, it's compulsory for GH actions leak)*, it should be deleted or changed to the private state.\n- All HackerOne-managed triage team GitHub and GitLab profiles should be private to avoid additional info leaks.\n- All HackerOne-managed triage team GitHub and GitLab profiles shouldn't have predictable usernames.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe indirect leak of active and fixed HackerOne private vulnerability reports, which were under HackerOne-managed examination by inspecting files in public repositories. As such, I identified vulnerabilities belonging to 9 private reports using a quick look. There are still many repositories to process, and more will be published in the future: the last public repo, at least for ████, was dated 5 days ago.\n\nCVSS clarification:\n- Confidentiality is High due to the leak of private HackerOne-managed reports. The number of leaked reports here doesn't represent the final number, as I haven't processed all the repositories. Additionally, the future publishing of reports should be considered.",
