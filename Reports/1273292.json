As part of this team, I have access to a Slack Workspace which is used to coordinate engagements and communicate with customers. On July 22nd I replied to a message from another pentester who was reporting a functional bug on the platform. In my reply, I included a Gitlab link with the intention of pointing out that his report was a duplicate of an internal issue which had already been reported by another hacker. I noticed that the link automatically displayed a preview of the internal ticket, which of course, should only be seen by employees. Since Gitlab issue IDs are sequential, I tried iterating the IDs and discovered that I could access partial info from any internal Gitlab issue. The engineering team promptly implemented a fix and even discovered other ways in which this vulnerability may have been abused.",
