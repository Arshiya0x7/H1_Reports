  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\nI have found a stored cross site scripting vulnerability on `<any>.myshopify.com` through customer's first name in the checkout page after the order is completed.\n\n#Details:\nWhile processing an order on `checkout.shopif.com` customers are asked to enter their first name , last name , address details ..etc.\nIt's been found that the mentioned fields does not accept any HTML tags , so if you entered something like `<script>alert(2);</script>` , it will be rejected and you'll see a message saying `cannot contain HTML tags` . \nHowever, for some reason the only tag that you can include and it won't be rejected is `<html>` tag itself :D \nSo , something like `<html onmouseover=alert(1)>` will be accepted.\n\nAfter completing the order you'll land at a **thank** page saying that the order was confirmed , the XSS vulnerability lies in that page due to not sanitizing the first name of the customer inside the `<title>` tag.\n\n#Steps to reproduce:\n1. As an admin create a product with $0 price and $0 taxes on shipping so that you don't have to to enter any credit card details (the price doesn't matter , it's just to make testing easier).\n2. As a user go to the product you created and buy it.\n3. You'll be redirected to a page in `checkout.shopify.com` asking you to enter your details.\n4. In the first name field enter `</title></head><html onmouseover=alert(2)>` .\n5. Fill the other fields then click **Continue to shipping method** --> **Continue to payment method** --> **Complete order** \n6. XSS will trigger on `checkout.shopify.com` , to get the payload executed on `<your_store>.myshopify.com` , just go to `<your_store>.myshopify.com/0/checkouts/<checkout_id>/thank_you`\n\nHere is a live PoC: `https://zh5402.myshopify.com/14372648/checkouts/5e566284338e71d6adc542b6567b4cf0/thank_you`\n{F141546}\n\n\n#Impact:\nThrough this vulnerability an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript at `<any>.myshopify.com` on admins and any other users to perform malicious actions such as fetching the CSRF token and using it to perform malicious requests , stealing sensitive information ..etc.",
