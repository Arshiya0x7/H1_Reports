We however failed to recognize it and merge the two reports as duplicates, which is why we decided to reconsider the reward here.\n\nThe original report only described a way to repeat requests and send multiple emails. We do not consider this to be a security issue. However, later on @haxta4ok00 identifies it is possible to request mediation on reports that were too old to mediate, which is the same as what was reported in #159512. This has a very minor security implication, which prompted us to reconsider our response here.\n\nWe originally posted in #159512:\n> @troubleshooter identified a discrepancy between our frontend and backend validation. While our frontend did not allow hackers to request mediation on reports that were too old to mediate, a forged request would still be accepted by our backend due to different validation rules. While this has minor security implications, we decided to make the validations consistent and award our minimum bounty of $500 here.",
