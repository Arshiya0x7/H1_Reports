  "vulnerability_information": "Dear Team,\n\nThere are password change issues with uber.\nthere are two issues:\n1)User is not receiving notification when he reset password via password reset link.\n2)Password reset link is not expiring after used once.\n\nGood thing: when user change his info like profile update, password change. User get email notification for password change etc.\n\nIssue: user not always gets a notification about password change. When user change his password via password reset link then such a notification is not send to the user.\n\nNow why user should get email notification. when he reset password using password reset link,  reset link should be one time usable but user's password reset link is not getting expired and if users email account get compromised he can reset users uber account password without notifying user.\n\nIt is good practice to always send email notification for user for any user related info update.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1)Go on password reset link: https://login.uber.com/forgot-password\n2)put email address and get password reset link on email in my case: https://login.uber.com/pw/f42ba1449f06694893f2bbdaf2d1****\n3) now to check if user getting email notification: log into account and reset password from profile. user will get email notification.\n4) now again change password by password reset link user will not get any notification for password change.\n5) User can use same link for n number of time to reset his password.\nif this link get leaked or account compromised anybody can reset legitimate users password. \n\nPlease let me know if more details required.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nNinad Sarang",
