  "vulnerability_information": "This was found while evaluating the vulnerability and patch identified in #419896.  I determined the deployed patch to be effective.  However, I noticed tracer values could be sent which didn't conform to the UUID specification as characters outside of the a-f and 0-9 ranges could be used.  For example, a value such as \"zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzzzz\" was accepted by the server as valid.  Likely this indicates a problem with a regex filter that needs to be slightly changed.  \n\nSteps\n1. Navigate to a program which allows anonymous submissions.\n2. Open the report submission form and add an attachment.\n3. Observe the request sent to /attachments includes a client side generated UUID in the tracer field.\n4. Replay the request from step 3.  Use an invalid UUID (e.g. \"zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzzzz\") for the tracer and observe the server accepts the value.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact is unknown, but it is believed to have a cascading side effect.  I was asked to submit this by @jobert.",
