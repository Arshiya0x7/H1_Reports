  "vulnerability_information": "Security researchers from Ruhr University Bochum have discovered a vulnerability in the Secure Shell (**[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)**) cryptographic network protocol that could allow an attacker to downgrade the connection's security by breaking the integrity of the secure channel.\n\nCalled **Terrapin** (**[CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795)**, CVSS score: 5.9), the exploit has been described as the \"first-ever practically exploitable prefix truncation attack.\"\n\nIn a real-world scenario, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to intercept sensitive data or gain control over critical systems using administrator-privileged access.\n\nWeak SSH algorithms refer to the encryption and key exchange methods utilized in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, highlighting the security vulnerabilities or obsolescence associated with these algorithms. SSH is a protocol for establishing secure network connections and is often used to provide secure access to remote systems. However, some outdated or vulnerable algorithms can increase information security risks.\n\nWhen such weak algorithms are used, attackers can more easily access encrypted data by targeting these vulnerabilities. Weak SSH algorithms can make it easier for malicious actors to crack passwords or gain access. Furthermore, using these algorithms makes secure connections more vulnerable and can increase the risk of unauthorized access\n\nHackerOne report :\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/2431683 ( nextcloud report)\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/318068\n\n**Reference:**\n\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2024/01/new-terrapin-flaw-could-let-attackers.html\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nearly-11-million-ssh-servers-vulnerable-to-new-terrapin-attacks/\n\nhttps://threatmon.io/vulnerability/weak-ssh-algorithms-discovered/\n\nhttps://jfrog.com/blog/ssh-protocol-flaw-terrapin-attack-cve-2023-48795-all-you-need-to-know/\n\nhttps://terrapin-attack.com/\n\nTarget :\n\n[scan.nextcloud.com](http://scan.nextcloud.com) (95.217.53.149)\n\n**Step To Reproduce:**\n\n**1: Detection for Weak and vulnerable algorithms**\n\nTools: Nmap,ssh-audit\n\n```jsx\nnmap --script ssh2-enum-algos target -sV -p- \n\n# SSH-AUDIT \nssh-audit Target \n\nhttps://www.sshaudit.com/\n```\n\nssh-audit scan file :\n\nnmap scan file : \n\n2 : Detection for **Terrapin Attack**\n\nTo be vulnerable the connection must be secured by either ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC and no kex-strict-?[-v00@openssh.com](mailto:-v00@openssh.com) key exchange marker is offered by this target.\n\nThey also created vulnerability scanner for this :\n\nhttps://github.com/RUB-NDS/Terrapin-Scanner\n\n### **Brief description :**\n\n1. **Deprecated & Weak SHA-1 Algorithm In UseAffected Algorithms:References:**\n    \n    **Description:** SHA-1 is known to have several practical & exploitable weaknesses.\n    \n    - ssh-rsa\n    - diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\n    - hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com\n    - hmac-sha1\n    \n    **Solution:** Replace SHA-1 with SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512\n    \n    - Stevens, M., Bursztein, E., Karpman, P., Albertini, A., Markov, Y., \"The first collision for full SHA-1\", <https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf>, Retrieved Jun. 1, 2017.\n    - Google, Inc., \"Gradually sunsetting SHA-1\", <https://security.googleblog.com/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html>, Published Sept. 5, 2014, Retrieved Jun. 1, 2017.\n    - Leurent, G., Peyrin, T., \"SHA-1 is a Shambles\", <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>, Retrieved Feb. 8, 2020.\n2. **Possibly Compromised NIST P-Curves In UseAffected Algorithms:References:**\n    \n    **Description:** The NIST P-curves are strongly suspected by some as being back-doored by the NSA.\n    \n    - ecdsa-sha2-nistp256\n    - ecdh-sha2-nistp256\n    - ecdh-sha2-nistp384\n    - ecdh-sha2-nistp521\n    \n    **Solution:** Replace ECDSA host keys with RSA and/or ED25519 host keys.

According to the **[Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/public-wifi-risks/), 40% of respondents had their information compromised while using public Wi-Fi**. **People most commonly use public Wi-Fi in cafes and restaurants (38%), hotels (38%), and libraries (33%) majority of people (56%) connect to public Wi-Fi networks that don't require a password, while 44% connect to networks that do. In the US, 47% of people say they use public Wi-Fi regularly. And that’s no surprise, as Americans continue to [work remotely](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/work-from-home-habits), attend school online, and save their cellular data while they’re out and about.**\n\nInternet provider companies and government agencies spy on citizens by catching our internet traffic, This type of spoofing attack against civilians now become an open secret.\n\nYou and me also everyone use public wifi networks, chilling in a cafe with friends, and working remotely now become a part of our life so this type of bug is now becoming more alarming than ever. Using a VPN will decrease internet speed that's why a VPN isn't a solution.\n\n- Weak SSH algorithms utilize cryptographic algorithms that are vulnerable to attacks, making it easier for malicious actors to decrypt sensitive data transmitted over SSH connections. This can lead to the **exposure of confidential information, Hampering the integrity of SSH protocol, also this will help an attacker to gain access to the server.**\n- Due to Week ssh algorithms this makes your servers vulnerable to [CVE-2023-48795](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/cve_discovery?id=CVE-2023-48795)\n\n**Internet service providers and Attackers in Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) position can exploit this vulnerability to hack your company if we don't consider this seriously this could lead to a cyber attack against your company.**\n\nYour company's activities show that you guys Consider data security very carefully.**Gratefully I can say Security is your main priority and you should know that confidentiality integrity availability (CIA ) is the piler of security. This type of vulnerability is the most alarming to us for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of our data.**\n\n**Your server scored an F grade As a well-known company Nextcloud deserves the best security, hope this report will help you to make this server an A grader**",
