  "vulnerability_information": "The `antispambot` function escapes some randomly selected characters from its first argument, for example:\n\n```\n<?php\necho antispambot( 'example@example.com' );\n```\n\nThis would print out:\n\n```\nexa&#109;p&#108;&#101;&#64;&#101;xa&#109;pl&#101;&#46;&#99;o&#109;\n```\n\nSince this returns HTML, developers are not going to use `esc_html` with the return value of `antispambot`, since that would double-escape the result. Developers will assume that this function can be safely used with untrusted email addresses, which is a fair assumption. However, it turns out that `antispambot` cannot be trusted. Whether a character is escaped is randomly selected, even if the character is `<`, `>`, `&`, `\"`, or `'`. These last five characters should always be escaped.\n\nThere is a chance that this will print out unescaped:\n\n```\n<?php\necho antispambot( '<script>console.log(\"hello\");</script>');\n```\n\nEven though the chance of this happening is low, with enough repetitions this could happen eventually.\n\n`antispambot` should always escape the five sensitive characters.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf `antispambot` is being used by a plugin that passes to it untrusted input, an attacker could cause arbitrary client-side code to run. Since the probability of all of the characters remaining unescaped is low, only a small fraction of the attacks would succeed, and the attacker would need the ability to attack many times to see a few successes.",
