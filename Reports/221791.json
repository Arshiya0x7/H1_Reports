  "vulnerability_information": "A TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message.\nThis would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are\nexcessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending\nreasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to\nservice a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for\nthe message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length\ncheck. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker\ncould force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead\nto a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message\nlength check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to\nimmediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the failed\nconneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be\nimmediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be\ntransitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:\n\n1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the\nevent that the connection fails\nor\n2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there\nis very little free memory\nor\n3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there\nare multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for\nthe connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is\ninsufficient memory to service the multiple requests.\n\nExcept in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to\nbe transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is\nsubsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an\nincreased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack\nof memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.\n\nThis issue does not affect DTLS users.\n\nrefer:\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt",
