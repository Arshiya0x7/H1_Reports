  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nI know you are more interested in vulnerabilities found in ownCloud Server, but I do would like to inform you on a RCE that can be executed on ci.owncloud.[com/org]. \n\n**Vulnerability**\nThere is a 0day vulnerability in Jenkins that can be exploited in certain circumstances. The Jenkins instance on ci.owncloud.[com/org] is vulnerabile for this attack since it is configured to run on a public IP address and is not firewalled.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the common library used by Java to (de)serialize data. Jenkins will deserialize and execute configuration data sent to a specific port it is listening on. More information on the vulnerability can be found in this [article](http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/).\n\nIt was easy to find the Jenkins instance because its name is easy guessable (only later on I found out its also being linked to from your GitHub page).\n\n**POC**\nI used a payload to confirm the RCE which tells me ci.jenkins.org is running `Debian 7`. You can use this information as confirmation on the RCE.\n\nI was also able to read the `/etc/passwd` file, but I'd rather not send the data it contains in this report.\n\n**Mitigation**\n- Shut down ci.owncloud.com for the time being\n- Run ci.owncloud.com on a VPN instead of on a world-accessible public IP address\n- Firewall the Jenkins instance\n\nRegards, @tomdev",
