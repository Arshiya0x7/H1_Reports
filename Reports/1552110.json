This affects SASL-enabled protocols: SMPTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).\n\nlibcurl maintains a pool of live connections after a transfer has completed (sometimes called the connection cache). This pool of connections is then gone through when a new transfer is requested and if there is a live connection available that can be reused, it is preferred instead of creating a new one.\n\nDue to this security vulnerability, a connection that is successfully created and authenticated with a user name + OAUTH2 bearer could subsequently be erroneously reused even for user + [other OAUTH2 bearer], even though that might not even be a valid bearer. This could lead to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.\n\nINFO\nThis flaw was introduced in curl in 2013 with the commit series that started with 19a05c908f7d8b.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2022-22576 to this issue.\nCWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\nSeverity: Medium\n\nAFFECTED VERSIONS\nAffected versions: curl 7.33.0 to and including 7.82.0\nNot affected versions: curl < 7.33.0 and curl >= 7.83.0\nNote that libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nA fix for CVE-2022-22576\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nWe suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:\nA - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.83.0\nB - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild\nC - Set the bearer string as password as well when using OAUTH2 bearer authentication with these protocols.\n\nTIME LINE\nIt was first reported to the curl project on March 18 2022. We contacted distros@openwall on April 18.\nlibcurl 7.83.0 was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.\n\nCREDITS\nReported and patched by Patrick Monnerat.\nThanks a lot!\n\nhttps://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-22576.html",
