  "vulnerability_information": "Hi guys,\n\nI am now able to prove my concerns from #227486 (see my last comment). `\"`s are still not correctly encoded when rendered into the page in the `<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"current_full_url\" />` element on almost any https://starbucks.co.uk/ page.\n\nThe WAF is bypassed by encoding `\"`s as `%2522` in the URL path. This won't work when the payload is part of the query string.\n\n**Description**\n\nTake a look on the source code of https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/card/egift/anthing%2522. You can see a quote is injected to break the `href` attribute context.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/card/egift/anthing\"\" />\n```\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nUsing the same tricks as described in #227486 this injection can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary JS execution on `/shop/paymentmethod/`. Also note that this is just **one** example and more ways may exist to achieve JS execution. Steps to reproduce (use **Firefox**):\n\n1. Login at https://www.starbucks.co.uk and add a card into basket on https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/card/egift/birthday\n2. Visit https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/paymentmethod/hkjhk%2522onclick=%2522confirm(/-/g+this.ownerDocument.domain)%2522id=%2522checkoutButton\n3. Click somewhere around the Checkout header. \n4. An alert showing the current domain pops up.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nAgain, correctly encode the URL before reflecting it back in the response. \n\nIn #227486 the fix was blocking requests containing `%u0022` in the query string. This was shown to be bypassable so fixing this issue by blocking `%2522` in URL paths could be bypassed again in future. \n\n",
