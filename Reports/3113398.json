  "vulnerability_information": "## Description\n\nDuring testing on ticketing platforms, I discovered that HackerOne's support ticket system is misconfigured, which introduces a security risk.\n\nCurrently, HackerOne has the email `███████` enabled to create and manage tickets on its support platform. This setup allows an attacker to abuse the ticketing system to register users on third-party platforms impersonating the domain `@hackerone.com`.  \nFor more technical details about a related finding, please refer to report #2834521 previously submitted.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Go to HackerOne's support portal at [https://support.hackerone.com/](https://support.hackerone.com/) and register as a customer using an email address under your control.\n2. Log into the support portal.\n3. In a new tab, open the inbox of the email you used and send an email to `████`.\n4. Return to the support portal and refresh the page. A new ticket should appear containing the contents of the email you sent.\n5. Open the ticket and add `█████` as a collaborator.\n6. Copy the ID of the newly created ticket.\n7. In a different browser or session, log into a Jira account you control.\n8. Visit [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/profile-and-visibility](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/profile-and-visibility) and replace the \"Public Name\" field with the ticket ID you copied.\n9. Go to [Trello.com](https://trello.com) using the same Jira account.\n10. If you don't have a workspace yet, create one. Then create a new board inside the workspace.\n11. Inside the board, click on the \"Invite\" button (usually located at the top right or in the sidebar).\n12. In the invitation field, enter a support email address such as `█████████` and send the invitation.\n13. Return to the HackerOne support portal and refresh the ticket page. A new message should appear containing the Trello invitation link.\n14. Copy the invitation link and open it in another browser.\n15. Complete the signup process using the invitation link. Since emails sent to `█████` are automatically processed as support tickets, attackers can retrieve verification and invitation links without needing direct inbox access.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could leverage this process to register on third-party platforms while impersonating `@hackerone.com`, gaining access to HackerOne's internal content and confidential resources.  \nSpecifically, by exploiting this method on Jira and Trello, an attacker could access HackerOne's internal workspaces, exposing sensitive documents, links, and SAML keys.\n\nFor example, using this technique, it is possible to access `https://hackerone.atlassian.net/` and view internal organizational content, including SAML credentials and other critical information.\n",
