The banners and promotional product for the E-commerce website were managed from a third party \"mini-program\" application, which had an integration with the E-commerce website. This third party application was hosted on a separate subdomain.\n\nThis report contained the following steps / escalations:\nFirst, a GraphQL API endpoint was discovered and enumerated. Because introspection was enabled, the reporter had visibility into all possible queries and mutations.\nNext, the researcher could create his own user account using a mutation called `Register`. This account gave access to some authenticated functionalities within the GraphQL API. \nLast, with the authenticated access the researcher escalated privileges using a mutation called `CreateAdminUser`. This gave access to even more functionalities within the API.\n\nWith the access of this privileged account, the reporter:\n- Had access to many features in the GraphQL API\n- Could have modified banners who would have ended up on the front page of the e-commerce website\n- Could modify features of the promotional products (prices, pictures etcetera.)",
