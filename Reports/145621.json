I believe these files were uploaded before the security checks were implemented but I am not 100% sure about it. On recently uploaded files, authentication is indeed required so I believe this only applies to certain old files. Nevertheless, this is still information leakage (sensitive in some cases) and I believe all file access requests should be requiring authentication - whether old or new.\n\nWe confirmed that a lot of our files (sensitive images) that we uploaded (before 2016 around the same time when the security checks were implemented) are still accessible publicly without any authentication. This is a serious concern for us because these files (images) are sensitive and we wouldn't want anyone to get hold of them. We obviously rely on Slack to protect us against anyone accessing these old images as well even though the security checks are implemented for new files uploaded now.\n\nI am not going to send our own files as PoC but I just google searched for \"files.slack.com/files-tmb/\" and came across some files that were accessible without authentication. They are listed below:\n\nhttps://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T024MFP4J-F0J4R5MBN-2d878cd37b/add-new-color-scheme-inconsistency_360.png\n\nhttps://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0F8RH7U7-F0J505EG1-33434fadf3/screenshot_from_2015-12-28_15_23_39_160.png\n\nPS - some of these files that were publicly accessible were shared in private channels as well so it is not like only images shared in public channels were accessible.",
