  "vulnerability_information": "Hello, \n\nI would like to mention a bug here that is regarding changing the name of the owner of a leaderboard by a member that is first shown forbidden but when you again try to change owner's name you can see the changes to name made in the pop up that appears.\nBasically when I created a private leaderboard  named test1 on my account ███ then in the next step I sent invitation to ████ so as this email was also mine I accepted the request to join the leaderboard and then I visited the members section  of the leaderboard through my ████████ account (owner account)\n\nThere I saw an edit option for the name of the member of leaderboard test1 that was the member with email ███ , so before that I opened a new settings page and made the member with email ████ the owner and made my account role as member , see below \n\n{ ███████} \n\nThen on the editing page when i tried to edit the name of the user to testing  with email █████ which had now become the owner and I was a member so I got the below forbidden error \n\n{ ████████}\n\nBut when I clicked on edit button again I saw the pop up saying 'Enter new name for testing ' see below pic \n\n{ ████} \n\nSo clearly I was able to bypass the access control set for the members of a leaderboard.\nSo please patch it .\n\nRegards\nSahil tikoo",
