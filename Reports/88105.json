  "vulnerability_information": "__Description__\r\n\r\nWhen you search in pages such as the videos of some Category or the videos of some User, and you receive more than 0 results, the path of the URL is put in the attribute `data-start-page` of a `<li>` element without escaping. This allows to insert another attribute like `onmouseover` to execute Javascript code.\r\nTo exploit this bug, you need to retitle a video to something like `\"onmouseover=\"alert(document.domain)&#x2f;` and put the title as the search query in the URL. The character `/` has to be encoded like `&#x2f;` because if you send the character `/` as `%2F` you will get a 404 response.\r\n\r\n__Proof of concept__\r\n1. Upload a new video via https://vimeo.com/upload, or go to the Settings of one that you already uploaded.\r\n2. Enter `\"onmouseover=\"alert(document.domain)&#x2f;` for the _Title_ of the video.\r\n3. Click on _Save Changes_.\r\n4. Using other user, go to https://vimeo.com/[the_user_used_to_upload_the_video]/videos/search:%22onmouseover%3D%22alert%28document.domain%29%26%23x2f%3B/.\r\n5. Move your mouse over the thumbnail of the video that you uploaded (it should be the only video that appears in the results).\r\n6. `alert(document.domain)` is executed.\r\n\r\nTo see the proof of concept in action, you can go to https://vimeo.com/user36690798/videos/search:%22onmouseover%3D%22alert%28document.domain%29%26%23x2f%3B/.\r\n\r\nHappily, I can only reproduce it on Firefox, because XSS Auditor notices that `\"onmouseover=\"alert(document.domain)&#x2f;` appears in the document and in the URL. I will try a little more to reproduce it on Chrome too, but I see it very difficult.",
