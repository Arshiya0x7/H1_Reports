This affects some unknown functionality of the file /etc/gsissh/sshd_config. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-255. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The summary by CVE is:\n\nAn issue was discovered in gsi-openssh-server 7.9p1 on Fedora 29. If PermitPAMUserChange is set to yes in the /etc/gsissh/sshd_config file, logins succeed with a valid username and an incorrect password, even though a failure entry is recorded in the /var/log/messages file.\nThe bug was discovered 02/08/2019. The weakness was released 02/08/2019. This vulnerability is uniquely identified as CVE-2019-7639 since 02/08/2019. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely.

Install gsi-openssh-server\n2. Initialize rsa, ecdsa, ed25519 keys for gsi-openssh server using gsissh-keygen\n2. Set PermitPAMUserChange to yes in /etc/gsissh/sshd_config\n3. Run /usr/sbin/gsisshd\n4. Try to connect to the system using Putty with user \"root\" and some incorrect password like \"test1234\" (The actual password for root on the test system was root1234)\n\nActual results:\nUser gets logged in even though there is a failure entry in /var/log/messages for user authentication\n\n\nExpected results:\nUser should not be able to login unless he provides the correct password\n\nAdditional info:\nits possible that earlier versions might also be vulnerable.\n\n\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7639\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability",
