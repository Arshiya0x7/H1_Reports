I did not look at the signaling server.\nHowever the Turn server (esp inc credentials). Can be used by the attacker to proxy their web traffic trough.\nEsp in combination with your docs: https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/blob/master/docs/TURN.md\n\nThis would allow the access internal network on the turn server.\n\n## Impact\n\nAnybody (they do not even have to have a valid talk room) can request the turn server credentials of a Nextcloud server running Talk.\nIn combination with your guides on how to set those things up this can result in dangerous situations.\n\nI would furthermore advise to as a start only hand out turn credentials to guests that at least have access to a room.\nAnd to improve the documentation.",
