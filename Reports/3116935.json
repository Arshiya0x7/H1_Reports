  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nThe DES cipher (Data Encryption Standard) is used in the `curl_ntlm_core.c` file of libcurl. DES is considered insecure due to its short key length (56 bits) and its susceptibility to brute-force attacks. Modern cryptographic standards recommend replacing DES with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is more robust and secure.\n\n## Affected version\n[Which curl/libcurl version are you using to reproduce? On which platform? `curl -V` typically generates good output to include]\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Inspect the `lib/curl_ntlm_core.c` file of the libcurl source code.\n2. Locate the use of the `kCCAlgorithmDES` constant, which corresponds to the DES cipher.\n3. Verify that DES is being used for cryptographic operations in NTLM authentication (NTLMv1).\n## Supporting Material/References:\n- File: `lib/curl_ntlm_core.c`\n- Line Reference: 228:29\n- CWE Reference: [CWE-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)\n\n  * [attachment / reference]\n\n## Impact\n\n## Summary:\nUsing DES compromises the security of the application due to the following points:\n- **Brute-force attacks**: The short key length makes it possible to brute-force DES keys in a reasonable amount of time with modern hardware.\n- **Cryptographic weaknesses**: DES is vulnerable to various cryptanalysis techniques, such as differential and linear cryptanalysis.\n- **Compliance risks**: DES does not meet modern cryptographic standards and could lead to non-compliance with security regulations.\n\nAn attacker exploiting this vulnerability could:\n- Intercept and decrypt sensitive data during NTLM authentication.\n- Execute man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to impersonate a user or server.\n- Gain unauthorized access to systems relying on NTLM authentication.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Fix:\nReplace the use of `kCCAlgorithmDES` with `kCCAlgorithmAES`, which supports stronger encryption standards (e.g., AES-128, AES-256). This change will significantly enhance the security of NTLM authentication in libcurl.",
