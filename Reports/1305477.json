  "vulnerability_information": "Hello team,\nI hope you're doing well & healthy.\nI found a reflected XSS because of the misconfiguration of Akamai ARL.\n\n███████\n\n## References\n\n      - https://github.com/war-and-code/akamai-arl-hack\n      - https://twitter.com/SpiderSec/status/1421176297548435459\n      - https://warandcode.com/post/akamai-arl-hack/\n      - https://github.com/cybercdh/goarl\n      - https://community.akamai.com/customers/s/article/WebPerformanceV1V2ARLChangeStartingFebruary282021?language=en_US\n\n## Impact\n\nIf an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:\n    Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.\nView any information that the user is able to view.\nModify any information that the user is able to modify.\nInitiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.\n\n## System Host(s)\n███████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\nAkamai ARL\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\nHere is the **PoC**\n\nhttp://███/7/0/33/1d/www.citysearch.com/search?what=x&where=place%22%3E%3Csvg+onload=confirm(document.location)%3E\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nWeb application owners should keep their infrastructure up to date, and follow secure development best practices, avoiding Open Redirects and XSS vulnerabilities.\nSetting up specific WAF rules to detect and block XSS attacks and Open Redirects will increase the level of protection as well, and provide visibility to URLs that malicious users attempt to target.\n\nBest regards.\n@pirneci\n\n",
