This was clearly an attempt to bypass our reputation system and is a direct abuse of our multiple account policy. While HackerOne does allow you to have multiple accounts, we do not allow you to submit reports on behalf of other accounts that you own to manipulate reputation. \n\nWe originally determined that we would not award a bounty for this type of behavior, but then retracted this decision in favor of rewarding the researcher for the bug because it was determined to be valid. Let it be clear that this was a one time exception, and we do not condone this type of behavior. The researcher has deactivated the other duplicate account that was used. \n\nPlease review our multiple account policy here: https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/208135543",
